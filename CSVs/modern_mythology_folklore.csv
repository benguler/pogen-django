"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,",modern_mythology_folklore
Weak from the noon-day heat.,modern_mythology_folklore
"A church bell sounded mournfully far away,",modern_mythology_folklore
"I heard the cry of a baby,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the coughing of John Yarnell,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,",modern_mythology_folklore
Then the violent voice of my wife:,modern_mythology_folklore
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!",modern_mythology_folklore
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.,modern_mythology_folklore
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...,modern_mythology_folklore
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Too late! Thus I came here,",modern_mythology_folklore
"With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,",modern_mythology_folklore
Though one must breathe,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,",modern_mythology_folklore
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.,modern_mythology_folklore
When I felt the bullet enter my heart,modern_mythology_folklore
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,",modern_mythology_folklore
Instead of running away and joining the army.,modern_mythology_folklore
Rather a thousand times the county jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.",modern_mythology_folklore
"What do they mean, anyway?I was only eight years old;",modern_mythology_folklore
And before I grew up and knew what it meant,modern_mythology_folklore
"I had no words for it, except",modern_mythology_folklore
That I was frightened and told my,modern_mythology_folklore
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol,modern_mythology_folklore
"And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",modern_mythology_folklore
Nevertheless the story clung to me.,modern_mythology_folklore
"But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,",modern_mythology_folklore
Was a newcomer and never heard it,modern_mythology_folklore
Till two years after we were married.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Then he considered himself cheated,",modern_mythology_folklore
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, he deserted me, and I died",modern_mythology_folklore
The following winter.,modern_mythology_folklore
Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_mythology_folklore
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_mythology_folklore
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_mythology_folklore
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_mythology_folklore
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_mythology_folklore
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_mythology_folklore
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_mythology_folklore
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_mythology_folklore
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_mythology_folklore
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_mythology_folklore
Was there another Troy for her to burn?I ,modern_mythology_folklore
GLOOM! ,modern_mythology_folklore
An October like November; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"August a hundred thousand hours, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And all September, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And half October like a thousand years . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
That then was Antwerp. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"In the name of God, ",modern_mythology_folklore
How could they do it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Those souls that usually dived ,modern_mythology_folklore
Into the dirty caverns of mines; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Who usually hived ,modern_mythology_folklore
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Those men there, with the appearance of clods ",modern_mythology_folklore
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God ,modern_mythology_folklore
Ever shrived. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. ,modern_mythology_folklore
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them ,modern_mythology_folklore
"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. ,modern_mythology_folklore
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours ,modern_mythology_folklore
"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays ",modern_mythology_folklore
"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",modern_mythology_folklore
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the gloom. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
What the devil will he gain by it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,modern_mythology_folklore
Waiting his doom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Till the trench of gray mud ,modern_mythology_folklore
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, there have been scars ",modern_mythology_folklore
Won in many wars . . .,modern_mythology_folklore
"Punic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
Doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",modern_mythology_folklore
An image that shall take long to pass! ,modern_mythology_folklore
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,modern_mythology_folklore
Forever through our brains. ,modern_mythology_folklore
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,modern_mythology_folklore
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Stand, for ever true; ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Watches them pass ,modern_mythology_folklore
In our minds for ever . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
But that clutter of sodden corses ,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sodden Belgian grass ,modern_mythology_folklore
That is a strange new beauty. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
The way of beauty . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
For you cannot praise it with words ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",modern_mythology_folklore
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that shall be an honourable name; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't know. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,modern_mythology_folklore
Over their fields and between their cities ,modern_mythology_folklore
Down into more southerly regions. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
Was it just love of their land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Oh, poor dears! ",modern_mythology_folklore
Can any man so love his land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,modern_mythology_folklore
And rivers and rivers of tears ,modern_mythology_folklore
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is midnight; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is a great crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
And no light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",modern_mythology_folklore
She has a dead face; ,modern_mythology_folklore
She is dressed all in black; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
At the back of the crowd; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And back again and again back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
She sways and wanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is one o'clock. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"There is still a great cloud, and very little light; ",modern_mythology_folklore
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
That hardly whispers aloud. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And now! .  . That is another dead mother, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And there is another and another and another. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And little children, all in black, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the dim gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
These are the women of Flanders.,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train ,modern_mythology_folklore
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, ",modern_mythology_folklore
In the dark of the night. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is very little light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is so much pain. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"This October like November, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"That August like a hundred thousand hours, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And that September, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And half October like a thousand years. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Oh, poor dears!As I went up by Ovillers",modern_mythology_folklore
"In mud and water cold to the knee,",modern_mythology_folklore
"There went three jeering, fleering spectres,",modern_mythology_folklore
That walked abreast and talked of me.,modern_mythology_folklore
"The first said, Heres a right brave soldier",modern_mythology_folklore
That walks the dark unfearingly;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Soon hell come back on a fine stretcher,",modern_mythology_folklore
And laughing for a nice Blighty.,modern_mythology_folklore
"The second, Read his face, old comrade,",modern_mythology_folklore
No kind of lucky chance I see;,modern_mythology_folklore
"One day hell freeze in mud to the marrow,",modern_mythology_folklore
Then look his last on Picardie.,modern_mythology_folklore
Though bitter the word of these first twain,modern_mythology_folklore
Curses the third spat venomously;,modern_mythology_folklore
Hell stay untouched till the wars last dawning,modern_mythology_folklore
Then live one hour of agony.,modern_mythology_folklore
Liars the first two were. Behold me,modern_mythology_folklore
At sloping arms by one  two  three;,modern_mythology_folklore
Waiting the time I shall discover,modern_mythology_folklore
Whether the third spake verity.She was a village,modern_mythology_folklore
Of lovely knowledge,modern_mythology_folklore
"The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.",modern_mythology_folklore
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless",modern_mythology_folklore
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.,modern_mythology_folklore
"And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even",modern_mythology_folklore
Having got given,modern_mythology_folklore
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few,modern_mythology_folklore
"Doubt, not many have seen,",modern_mythology_folklore
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Home of Twelfth Night  Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.",modern_mythology_folklore
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Till I got back I was dumb.If it were not for England, who would bear",modern_mythology_folklore
This heavy servitude one moment more?,modern_mythology_folklore
"To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor",modern_mythology_folklore
Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare,modern_mythology_folklore
"With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there",modern_mythology_folklore
"Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er",modern_mythology_folklore
"By fools made brazen by conceit, and store",modern_mythology_folklore
Of antique witticisms thin and bare.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Only the love of comrades sweetens all,",modern_mythology_folklore
Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.,modern_mythology_folklore
As night-watching men wait for the sun,modern_mythology_folklore
"To hearten them, so wait I on such boys",modern_mythology_folklore
"As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise.Only the wanderer",modern_mythology_folklore
"Knows England's graces,",modern_mythology_folklore
Or can anew see clear,modern_mythology_folklore
Familiar faces.,modern_mythology_folklore
And who loves joy as he,modern_mythology_folklore
That dwells in shadows?,modern_mythology_folklore
"Do not forget me quite,",modern_mythology_folklore
"O Severn meadows.Little did I dream, England, that you bore me",modern_mythology_folklore
"Under the Cotswold hills beside the water meadows,",modern_mythology_folklore
"To do you dreadful service, here, beyond your borders",modern_mythology_folklore
And your enfolding seas.,modern_mythology_folklore
"I was a dreamer ever, and bound to your dear service,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Meditating deep, I thought on your secret beauty,",modern_mythology_folklore
As through a child's face one may see the clear spirit,modern_mythology_folklore
Miraculously shining.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Your hills not only hills, but friends of mine and kindly,",modern_mythology_folklore
Your tiny knolls and orchards hidden beside the river,modern_mythology_folklore
"Muddy and strongly flowing, with shy and tiny streamlets",modern_mythology_folklore
Safe in its bosom.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now these are memories only, and your skies and rushy sky-pools",modern_mythology_folklore
Fragile mirrors easily broken by moving airs ...,modern_mythology_folklore
"But deep in my heart for ever goes on your daily being,",modern_mythology_folklore
And uses consecrate.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Think on me too, O Mother, who wrest my soul to serve you",modern_mythology_folklore
In strange and fearful ways beyond your encircling waters;,modern_mythology_folklore
"None but you can know my heart, its tears and sacrifice;",modern_mythology_folklore
"None, but you, repay.He's gone, and all our plans",modern_mythology_folklore
Are useless indeed.,modern_mythology_folklore
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,modern_mythology_folklore
Where the sheep feed,modern_mythology_folklore
Quietly and take no heed.,modern_mythology_folklore
His body that was so quick,modern_mythology_folklore
Is not as you,modern_mythology_folklore
"Knew it, on Severn river",modern_mythology_folklore
Under the blue,modern_mythology_folklore
Driving our small boat through.,modern_mythology_folklore
You would not know him now ...,modern_mythology_folklore
But still he died,modern_mythology_folklore
"Nobly, so cover him over",modern_mythology_folklore
With violets of pride,modern_mythology_folklore
Purple from Severn side.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Cover him, cover him soon!",modern_mythology_folklore
And with thick-set,modern_mythology_folklore
Masses of memoried flowers,modern_mythology_folklore
Hide that red wet,modern_mythology_folklore
"Thing I must somehow forget.Now, youth, the hour of thy dread passion comes;",modern_mythology_folklore
Thy lovely things must all be laid away;,modern_mythology_folklore
"And thou, as others, must face the riven day",modern_mythology_folklore
"Unstirred by rattle of the rolling drums,",modern_mythology_folklore
Or bugles' strident cry. When mere noise numbs,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sense of being, the sick soul doth sway,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Remember thy great craft's honour, that they may say",modern_mythology_folklore
Nothing in shame of poets. Then the crumbs,modern_mythology_folklore
Of praise the little versemen joyed to take,modern_mythology_folklore
"Shall be forgotten; then they must know we are,",modern_mythology_folklore
"For all our skill in words, equal in might",modern_mythology_folklore
And strong of mettle as those we honoured; make,modern_mythology_folklore
"The name of poet terrible in just war,",modern_mythology_folklore
And like a crown of honour upon the fight.When I remember plain heroic strength,modern_mythology_folklore
"And shining virtue shown by Ypres pools,",modern_mythology_folklore
Then read the blither written by knaves for fools,modern_mythology_folklore
"In praise of English soldiers lying at length,",modern_mythology_folklore
Who purely dream what England shall be made,modern_mythology_folklore
"Gloriously new, free of the old stains",modern_mythology_folklore
"By us, who pay the price that must be paid,",modern_mythology_folklore
Will freeze all winter over Ypres plains.,modern_mythology_folklore
Our silly dreams of peace you put aside,modern_mythology_folklore
"And brotherhood of man, for you will see",modern_mythology_folklore
"An armed mistress, braggart of the tide,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Her children slaves, under your mastery.",modern_mythology_folklore
"We'll have a word there too, and forge a knife,",modern_mythology_folklore
Will cut the cancer threatens England's life.,modern_mythology_folklore
"So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss",modern_mythology_folklore
"Of Time and Memory, the Muses came",modern_mythology_folklore
"To be the means of rich oblivion,",modern_mythology_folklore
And rest from cares.  And when the Thunderer,modern_mythology_folklore
"Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him",modern_mythology_folklore
"For pity of mankind. But the great law,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Which is the law of music, not of bread,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled",modern_mythology_folklore
"His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,",modern_mythology_folklore
And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.,modern_mythology_folklore
"So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew",modern_mythology_folklore
His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure,modern_mythology_folklore
"And fortify the city, then he took",modern_mythology_folklore
"The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched",modern_mythology_folklore
"The stones move and assemble, till a wall",modern_mythology_folklore
Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel,modern_mythology_folklore
Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.,modern_mythology_folklore
What other power but harmony can build,modern_mythology_folklore
"A city, and what gift so magical",modern_mythology_folklore
As that by which a city lifts its walls?,modern_mythology_folklore
"So men, in years to come, shall feel the power",modern_mythology_folklore
Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought,modern_mythology_folklore
"Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.",modern_mythology_folklore
The stones shall rise in towers to answer him.My bands of silk and miniver,modern_mythology_folklore
Momently grew heavier;,modern_mythology_folklore
The black gauze was beggarly thin;,modern_mythology_folklore
The ermine muffled mouth and chin;,modern_mythology_folklore
I could not suck the moonlight in.,modern_mythology_folklore
Harlequin in lozenges,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of love and hate, I walked in these",modern_mythology_folklore
Striped and ragged rigmaroles;,modern_mythology_folklore
Along the pavement my footsoles,modern_mythology_folklore
Trod warily on living coals.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,",modern_mythology_folklore
"In their corrupt disguises clothed,",modern_mythology_folklore
Morality I could not tear,modern_mythology_folklore
"From my ribs, to leave them bare",modern_mythology_folklore
Ivory in silver air.,modern_mythology_folklore
"There I walked, and there I raged;",modern_mythology_folklore
The spiritual savage caged,modern_mythology_folklore
"Within my skeleton, raged afresh",modern_mythology_folklore
"To feel, behind a carnal mesh,",modern_mythology_folklore
The clean bones crying in the flesh.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Behoild Pelides with his yellow hair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;",modern_mythology_folklore
Above the frowning of his brows of wove,modern_mythology_folklore
"A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Mastering love, resentment, and despair.",modern_mythology_folklore
"He knew his end, and Phoebus arrow sure",modern_mythology_folklore
"He braved for fame immortal and a friend,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Despising life; and we, who know our end,",modern_mythology_folklore
Know that in our decay he shall endure,modern_mythology_folklore
"And all our childrens hearts to grief inure,",modern_mythology_folklore
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who",modern_mythology_folklore
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?,modern_mythology_folklore
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth,modern_mythology_folklore
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?,modern_mythology_folklore
"A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw",modern_mythology_folklore
"Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;",modern_mythology_folklore
"A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,",modern_mythology_folklore
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep",modern_mythology_folklore
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer;,modern_mythology_folklore
But far away new generations keep,modern_mythology_folklore
Thy laurels fresh; where branching Isis hems,modern_mythology_folklore
"The lawns of Oxford round about, or where",modern_mythology_folklore
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.,modern_mythology_folklore
I gaze on thee as Phidias of old,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw",modern_mythology_folklore
"These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,",modern_mythology_folklore
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Unhappy me who only may behold,",modern_mythology_folklore
Nor make immutable and fix in awe,modern_mythology_folklore
"A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,",modern_mythology_folklore
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!,modern_mythology_folklore
"The godlike mien, the lions lock and eye,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart",modern_mythology_folklore
Better than many words that part by part,modern_mythology_folklore
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole,modern_mythology_folklore
"In nature lives, nor can in marble die.",modern_mythology_folklore
The perfect body itself the soul.,modern_mythology_folklore
"I had come to the house, in a cave of trees,",modern_mythology_folklore
Facing a sheer sky.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Everything moved,a bell hung ready to strike,",modern_mythology_folklore
Sun and reflection wheeled by.,modern_mythology_folklore
When the bare eyes were before me,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the hissing hair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Held up at a window, seen through a door.",modern_mythology_folklore
"The stiff bald eyes, the serpents on the forehead",modern_mythology_folklore
Formed in the air.,modern_mythology_folklore
This is a dead scene forever now.,modern_mythology_folklore
Nothing will ever stir.,modern_mythology_folklore
"The end will never brighten it more than this,",modern_mythology_folklore
Nor the rain blur.,modern_mythology_folklore
"The water will always fall, and will not fall,",modern_mythology_folklore
And the tipped bell make no sound.,modern_mythology_folklore
The grass will always be growing for hay,modern_mythology_folklore
Deep on the ground.,modern_mythology_folklore
And I shall stand here like a shadow,modern_mythology_folklore
"Under the great balanced day,",modern_mythology_folklore
"My eyes on the yellow dust, that was lifting in the wind,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And does not drift away.There may be chaos still around the world,",modern_mythology_folklore
This little world that in my thinking lies;,modern_mythology_folklore
For mine own bosom is the paradise,modern_mythology_folklore
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",modern_mythology_folklore
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,modern_mythology_folklore
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,modern_mythology_folklore
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",modern_mythology_folklore
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,modern_mythology_folklore
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,modern_mythology_folklore

Take them away as suddenly to somewhere,modern_mythology_folklore

I would have you meet this bartered blood.,modern_mythology_folklore

Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.,modern_mythology_folklore
Reflective conversion of all things,modern_mythology_folklore
"At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread",modern_mythology_folklore
"The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread",modern_mythology_folklore
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Inevitable, the body of the world",modern_mythology_folklore
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus,modern_mythology_folklore

That world which comes to each of us alone.,modern_mythology_folklore

Bent axle of devotion along companion ways,modern_mythology_folklore

Brazen hypnotics glitter here;,modern_mythology_folklore

Blest excursion! this ricochet,modern_mythology_folklore

While nigger cupids scour the stars!,modern_mythology_folklore
A thousand light shrugs balance us,modern_mythology_folklore
Through snarling hails of melody.,modern_mythology_folklore
White shadows slip across the floor,modern_mythology_folklore
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;,modern_mythology_folklore
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters,modern_mythology_folklore
Until somewhere a rooster banters.,modern_mythology_folklore
Greet naivelyyet intrepidly,modern_mythology_folklore

That cornets introduce at every turn,modern_mythology_folklore
And you may fall downstairs with me,modern_mythology_folklore
With perfect grace and equanimity.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or, plaintively scud past shores",modern_mythology_folklore
"Where, by strange harmonic laws",modern_mythology_folklore
"All relatives, serene and cool,",modern_mythology_folklore
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.,modern_mythology_folklore
"O,I have known metallic paradises",modern_mythology_folklore
Where cuckoos clucked to finches,modern_mythology_folklore
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.,modern_mythology_folklore
While titters hailed the groans of death,modern_mythology_folklore
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen,modern_mythology_folklore
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.,modern_mythology_folklore
This music has a reassuring way.,modern_mythology_folklore
The siren of the springs of guilty song,modern_mythology_folklore
Let us take her on the incandescent wax,modern_mythology_folklore
"Striated with nuances, nervosities",modern_mythology_folklore
"That we are heir to: she is still so young,",modern_mythology_folklore
"We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,",modern_mythology_folklore
Dipping here in this cultivated storm,modern_mythology_folklore
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.,modern_mythology_folklore
Capped arbiter of beauty in this street,modern_mythology_folklore
"That narrows darkly into motor dawn,",modern_mythology_folklore
"You, here beside me, delicate ambassador",modern_mythology_folklore
Of intricate slain numbers that arise,modern_mythology_folklore
"In whispers, naked of steel;",modern_mythology_folklore
religious gunman!,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,",modern_mythology_folklore
And in other ways than as the wind settles,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:,modern_mythology_folklore
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.,modern_mythology_folklore
"We even,",modern_mythology_folklore
Who drove speediest destruction,modern_mythology_folklore
"In corymbulous formations of mechanics,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice",modern_mythology_folklore
"Plangent over meadows, and looked down",modern_mythology_folklore
On rifts of torn and empty houses,modern_mythology_folklore
Like old women with teeth unjubilant,modern_mythology_folklore
"That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:",modern_mythology_folklore
"We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers",modern_mythology_folklore
"The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The mounted, yielding cities of the air!",modern_mythology_folklore
That saddled sky that shook down vertical,modern_mythology_folklore
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum,modern_mythology_folklore
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.,modern_mythology_folklore
"We did not ask for that, but have survived,",modern_mythology_folklore
And will persist to speak again before,modern_mythology_folklore
All stubble streets that have not curved,modern_mythology_folklore
"To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm",modern_mythology_folklore
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow,modern_mythology_folklore
To saturate with blessing and dismay.,modern_mythology_folklore
"A goose, tobacco and cologne",modern_mythology_folklore
"Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,",modern_mythology_folklore
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven,modern_mythology_folklore
"And spread with bells and voices, and atone",modern_mythology_folklore
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,",modern_mythology_folklore
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,",modern_mythology_folklore
"O brother-thief of time, that we recall.",modern_mythology_folklore
Laugh out the meager penance of their days,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who dare not share with us the breath released,",modern_mythology_folklore
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair,modern_mythology_folklore
"For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Distinctly praise the years, whose volatile",modern_mythology_folklore
Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height,modern_mythology_folklore
"The imagination spans beyond despair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.",modern_mythology_folklore
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.,modern_mythology_folklore
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern_mythology_folklore
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern_mythology_folklore
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern_mythology_folklore
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern_mythology_folklore
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern_mythology_folklore
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern_mythology_folklore
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern_mythology_folklore
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern_mythology_folklore
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern_mythology_folklore
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern_mythology_folklore
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern_mythology_folklore
View of the river. And we strode,modern_mythology_folklore
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern_mythology_folklore
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern_mythology_folklore
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern_mythology_folklore
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern_mythology_folklore
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern_mythology_folklore
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern_mythology_folklore
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern_mythology_folklore
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern_mythology_folklore
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern_mythology_folklore
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern_mythology_folklore
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern_mythology_folklore
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern_mythology_folklore
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern_mythology_folklore
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern_mythology_folklore
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern_mythology_folklore
Motionless in the meadows,modern_mythology_folklore
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern_mythology_folklore
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern_mythology_folklore
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern_mythology_folklore
The tree-toads started ringing,modern_mythology_folklore
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern_mythology_folklore
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern_mythology_folklore
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern_mythology_folklore
The rivers tiny canon,modern_mythology_folklore
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern_mythology_folklore
Like a dark and silent companion,modern_mythology_folklore
Evening held out her hands.,modern_mythology_folklore
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern_mythology_folklore
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern_mythology_folklore
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern_mythology_folklore
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern_mythology_folklore
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern_mythology_folklore
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern_mythology_folklore
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern_mythology_folklore
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern_mythology_folklore
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern_mythology_folklore
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern_mythology_folklore
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern_mythology_folklore
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern_mythology_folklore
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern_mythology_folklore
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern_mythology_folklore
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern_mythology_folklore
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern_mythology_folklore
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern_mythology_folklore
The woods became his background; every tree,modern_mythology_folklore
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern_mythology_folklore
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern_mythology_folklore
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern_mythology_folklore
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern_mythology_folklore
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern_mythology_folklore
With such a native element;,modern_mythology_folklore
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern_mythology_folklore
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern_mythology_folklore
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern_mythology_folklore
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern_mythology_folklore
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern_mythology_folklore
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no might",modern_mythology_folklore
"To make you hear,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Now, in the inmost night,",modern_mythology_folklore
I am so near,modern_mythology_folklore
"No whisper, falling light,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Divides us, dear.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no claim",modern_mythology_folklore
On your great hours.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now the thin candle-flame,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The closing flowers,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Wed summer with my name, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And these are ours.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Your shadow on the dust,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Strength, and a cry,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Delight, despair, mistrust, ",modern_mythology_folklore
All these am I.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Dawn, and the far hills thrust",modern_mythology_folklore
To a far sky.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no skill",modern_mythology_folklore
"To stay your tread,",modern_mythology_folklore
Now all that was my will,modern_mythology_folklore
Silence has said.,modern_mythology_folklore
We are one for good and ill,modern_mythology_folklore
"Since I am dead.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern_mythology_folklore
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Yes, Momus,",modern_mythology_folklore
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern_mythology_folklore
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern_mythology_folklore
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern_mythology_folklore
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern_mythology_folklore
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern_mythology_folklore
