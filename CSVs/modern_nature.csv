Knock knock He has closed his door,modern_nature
The gardens lilies have started to rot,modern_nature
So who is the corpse being carried from the house,modern_nature
You just knocked on his door,modern_nature
And trot trot,modern_nature
Trot goes little lady mouse,modern_nature
Translated from the French I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean,modern_nature
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes,modern_nature
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are,modern_nature
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes,modern_nature
House of dampness,modern_nature
House of burning,modern_nature
Seasons fastness,modern_nature
Season singing,modern_nature
The airplanes are laying eggs,modern_nature
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor,modern_nature
Watch out for the shooting black ichor,modern_nature
It would be good if you were to come from the sky,modern_nature
The skys honeysuckle is climbing,modern_nature
The earthly octopi are throbbing,modern_nature
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers,modern_nature
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks,modern_nature
Around the house is this ocean that you know well,modern_nature
  And is never still,modern_nature
"Translated from the French Wallace Stevens,",modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;",modern_nature
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold,modern_nature
"And bid them wander obeying your will,",modern_nature
"Flame under flame, till Time be no more;",modern_nature
"Have you not heard that our hearts are old,",modern_nature
"That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,",modern_nature
"In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?",modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still. Although you hide in the ebb and flow",modern_nature
"Of the pale tide when the moon has set,",modern_nature
The people of coming days will know,modern_nature
"About the casting out of my net,",modern_nature
And how you have leaped times out of mind,modern_nature
"Over the little silver cords,",modern_nature
"And think that you were hard and unkind,",modern_nature
"And blame you with many bitter words.She that but little patience knew,",modern_nature
"From childhood on, had now so much",modern_nature
A grey gull lost its fear and flew,modern_nature
"Down to her cell and there alit,",modern_nature
And there endured her fingers' touch,modern_nature
And from her fingers ate its bit.,modern_nature
Did she in touching that lone wing,modern_nature
Recall the years before her mind,modern_nature
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",modern_nature
Her thought some popular enmity:,modern_nature
Blind and leader of the blind,modern_nature
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,modern_nature
When long ago I saw her ride,modern_nature
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",modern_nature
The beauty of her country-side,modern_nature
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",modern_nature
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,modern_nature
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",modern_nature
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",modern_nature
When first it sprang out of the nest,modern_nature
Upon some lofty rock to stare,modern_nature
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",modern_nature
While under its storm-beaten breast,modern_nature
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",modern_nature
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",modern_nature
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,modern_nature
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",modern_nature
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,modern_nature
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",modern_nature
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",modern_nature
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",modern_nature
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,modern_nature
He fled the persecution of her glory,modern_nature
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",modern_nature
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,modern_nature
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",modern_nature
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",modern_nature
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",modern_nature
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",modern_nature
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",modern_nature
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",modern_nature
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",modern_nature
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,modern_nature
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,modern_nature
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,modern_nature
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,modern_nature
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. The woods of Arcady are dead,",modern_nature
And over is their antique joy;,modern_nature
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,modern_nature
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,modern_nature
Yet still she turns her restless head:,modern_nature
"But O, sick children of the world,",modern_nature
Of all the many changing things,modern_nature
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",modern_nature
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",modern_nature
Words alone are certain good.,modern_nature
"Where are now the warring kings,",modern_nature
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,modern_nature
Where are now the warring kings?,modern_nature
"An idle word is now their glory,",modern_nature
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",modern_nature
Reading some entangled story:,modern_nature
The kings of the old time are dead;,modern_nature
The wandering earth herself may be,modern_nature
"Only a sudden flaming word,",modern_nature
"In clanging space a moment heard,",modern_nature
Troubling the endless reverie.,modern_nature
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",modern_nature
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",modern_nature
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,modern_nature
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",modern_nature
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",modern_nature
"No learning from the starry men,",modern_nature
Who follow with the optic glass,modern_nature
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,modern_nature
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,modern_nature
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",modern_nature
And dead is all their human truth.,modern_nature
Go gather by the humming sea,modern_nature
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",modern_nature
"And to its lips thy story tell,",modern_nature
"And they thy comforters will be,",modern_nature
Rewarding in melodious guile,modern_nature
"Thy fretful words a little while,",modern_nature
Till they shall singing fade in ruth,modern_nature
And die a pearly brotherhood;,modern_nature
For words alone are certain good:,modern_nature
"Sing, then, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
I must be gone: there is a grave,modern_nature
"Where daffodil and lily wave,",modern_nature
"And I would please the hapless faun,",modern_nature
"Buried under the sleepy ground,",modern_nature
With mirthful songs before the dawn.,modern_nature
His shouting days with mirth were crowned;,modern_nature
"And still I dream he treads the lawn,",modern_nature
"Walking ghostly in the dew,",modern_nature
"Pierced by my glad singing through,",modern_nature
My songs of old earth's dreamy youth:,modern_nature
But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou!,modern_nature
For fair are poppies on the brow:,modern_nature
"Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.",modern_nature
Only the wanderer,modern_nature
"Knows England's graces,",modern_nature
Or can anew see clear,modern_nature
Familiar faces.,modern_nature
And who loves joy as he,modern_nature
That dwells in shadows?,modern_nature
"Do not forget me quite,",modern_nature
"O Severn meadows.He's gone, and all our plans",modern_nature
Are useless indeed.,modern_nature
We'll walk no more on Cotswold,modern_nature
Where the sheep feed,modern_nature
Quietly and take no heed.,modern_nature
His body that was so quick,modern_nature
Is not as you,modern_nature
"Knew it, on Severn river",modern_nature
Under the blue,modern_nature
Driving our small boat through.,modern_nature
You would not know him now ...,modern_nature
But still he died,modern_nature
"Nobly, so cover him over",modern_nature
With violets of pride,modern_nature
Purple from Severn side.,modern_nature
"Cover him, cover him soon!",modern_nature
And with thick-set,modern_nature
Masses of memoried flowers,modern_nature
Hide that red wet,modern_nature
Thing I must somehow forget.By a peninsula the painter sat and,modern_nature
Sketched the uneven valley groves.,modern_nature
The apostle gave alms to the,modern_nature
Meek. The volcano burst,modern_nature
In fusive sulphur and hurled,modern_nature
Rocks and ore into the air,modern_nature
Heavens sudden change at,modern_nature
"The drawing tempestuous,",modern_nature
Darkening shade of dense clouded hues.,modern_nature
The wanderer soon chose,modern_nature
His spot of rest; they bore the,modern_nature
"Chosen hero upon their shoulders,",modern_nature
"Whom they strangely admired, as",modern_nature
The beach-tide summer of people desired.Is this the river East I heard?,modern_nature
"Where the ferries, tugs and sailboats stirred",modern_nature
And the reaching wharves from the inner land,modern_nature
"Ourstretched, like the harmless receiving hand",modern_nature
And the silvery tinge that sparkles aloud,modern_nature
"Like the brilliant white demons, which a tide has towed",modern_nature
From the rays of the morning sun,modern_nature
Which it doth ceaselessly shine upon.,modern_nature
But look at the depth of the drippling tide,modern_nature
"The dripples, reripples like the locusts astride;",modern_nature
As the boat turns upon the silvery spread,modern_nature
It leavesstrangea shadow dead.,modern_nature
And the very charms from the reflective river,modern_nature
And from the stacks of the floating boat,modern_nature
There seemeth the quality neer to dissever,modern_nature
Like the ruffles from the mystified smoke. The motion of gathering loops of water,modern_nature
Must either burst or remain in a moment.,modern_nature
The violet colors through the glass,modern_nature
Throw up little swellings that appear,modern_nature
And spatter as soon as another strikes,modern_nature
And is born; so pure are they of colored,modern_nature
"Hues, that we feel the absent strength",modern_nature
Of its power. When they begin they gather,modern_nature
Like sand on the beach: each bubble,modern_nature
"Contains a complete eye of water.I went out to the hazel wood,",modern_nature
"Because a fire was in my head,",modern_nature
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",modern_nature
And hooked a berry to a thread;,modern_nature
"And when white moths were on the wing,",modern_nature
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",modern_nature
I dropped the berry in a stream,modern_nature
And caught a little silver trout.,modern_nature
When I had laid it on the floor,modern_nature
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",modern_nature
"But something rustled on the floor,",modern_nature
And someone called me by my name:,modern_nature
It had become a glimmering girl,modern_nature
With apple blossom in her hair,modern_nature
Who called me by my name and ran,modern_nature
And faded through the brightening air.,modern_nature
Though I am old with wandering,modern_nature
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",modern_nature
"I will find out where she has gone,",modern_nature
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,modern_nature
"And walk among long dappled grass,",modern_nature
"And pluck till time and times are done,",modern_nature
"The silver apples of the moon,",modern_nature
The golden apples of the sun.,modern_nature
Barque of phosphor,modern_nature
"On the palmy beach,",modern_nature
"Move outward into heaven,",modern_nature
Into the alabasters,modern_nature
And night blues.,modern_nature
Foam and cloud are one.,modern_nature
Sultry moon-monsters,modern_nature
Are dissolving.,modern_nature
Fill your black hull,modern_nature
With white moonlight.,modern_nature
There will never be an end,modern_nature
To this droning of the surf.The trade-wind jingles the rings in the nets around the racks by the docks on Indian River.,modern_nature
"It is the same jingle of the water among roots under the banks of the palmettoes,",modern_nature
It is the same jingle of the red-bird breasting the orange-treesout of the cedars.,modern_nature
"Yet there is no spring in Florida, neither in boskage perdu, nor on the nunnery beaches. Her terrace was the sand",modern_nature
And the palms and the twilight.,modern_nature
She made of the motions of her wrist,modern_nature
The grandiose gestures,modern_nature
Of her thought.,modern_nature
The rumpling of the plumes,modern_nature
Of this creature of the evening,modern_nature
Came to be sleights of sails,modern_nature
Over the sea.,modern_nature
And thus she roamed,modern_nature
"In the roamings of her fan,",modern_nature
"Partaking of the sea,",modern_nature
"And of the evening,",modern_nature
As they flowed around,modern_nature
And uttered their subsiding sound.As the immense dew of Florida,modern_nature
Brings forth,modern_nature
The big-finned palm,modern_nature
"And green vine angering for life,",modern_nature
As the immense dew of Florida,modern_nature
Brings forth hymn and hymn,modern_nature
"From the beholder,",modern_nature
Beholding all these green sides,modern_nature
"And gold sides of green sides,",modern_nature
"And blessed mornings,",modern_nature

Shall never don again its green array.,modern_nature
"Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,",modern_nature
Have something of their friendliness resigned;,modern_nature
"Another, if I would, I could not find,",modern_nature

But yet I treasure in my memory,modern_nature
"Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,",modern_nature

"For these once mine, my life is rich with these.",modern_nature
"And I scarce know which part may greater be,",modern_nature
"What I keep of you, or you rob of me.",modern_nature
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight,modern_nature
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;,modern_nature
"Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,",modern_nature
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.,modern_nature
And I half know why heaven deemed it right,modern_nature
"Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;",modern_nature
"God hath them still, for ever they avail,",modern_nature
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.,modern_nature
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run,modern_nature
"Where all the great things live that lived of yore,",modern_nature
And in eternal quiet float and soar;,modern_nature
"There all my loves are gathered into one,",modern_nature
"Where change is not, nor parting any more,",modern_nature
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.,modern_nature
In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung,modern_nature
"To toll your passing, had you not been dead;",modern_nature
For time a sadder mask than death may spread,modern_nature
Over the face that ever should be young.,modern_nature
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung,modern_nature
"Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head",modern_nature
"Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed",modern_nature
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.,modern_nature

"Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,",modern_nature
"Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,",modern_nature
"Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear",modern_nature
In our weak virtues monuments to you.,modern_nature
But then there comes that moment rare,modern_nature
"When, for no cause that I can find,",modern_nature
The little voices of the air,modern_nature
Sound above all the sea and wind.,modern_nature
The sea and wind do then obey,modern_nature
"And sighing, sighing double notes",modern_nature
"Of double basses, content to play",modern_nature
A droning chord for the little throats,modern_nature
The little throats that sing and rise,modern_nature
Up into the light with lovely ease,modern_nature
"And a kind of magical, sweet surprise",modern_nature
To hear and know themselves for these,modern_nature
"For these little voices: the bee, the fly,",modern_nature
"The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,",modern_nature
"The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,",modern_nature
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes,modern_nature
"Even iron can put forth,",modern_nature
Even iron.,modern_nature
"This is the iron age,",modern_nature
But let us take heart,modern_nature

December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.,modern_nature
"The almond-tree,",modern_nature
"That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake",modern_nature
In supreme bitterness.,modern_nature
"Upon the iron, and upon the steel,",modern_nature
"Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,",modern_nature
Odd crumbs of melting snow.,modern_nature
"But you mistake, it is not from the sky;",modern_nature
"From out the iron, and from out the steel,",modern_nature
"Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,",modern_nature
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth,modern_nature
"Along the iron, to the living steel",modern_nature
"In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow",modern_nature
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.,modern_nature
"Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,",modern_nature
"Iron-breaking,",modern_nature
The rusty swords of almond-trees.,modern_nature
"Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.",modern_nature
"They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages",modern_nature
"Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,",modern_nature
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet,modern_nature
"The heart of blossom,",modern_nature
The unquenchable heart of blossom!,modern_nature
"Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,",modern_nature
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon,modern_nature
From the small wound-stump.,modern_nature
"Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree",modern_nature
"Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.",modern_nature
"And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!",modern_nature
"This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,",modern_nature
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees,modern_nature
"Iron, but unforgotten,",modern_nature
"Iron, dawn-hearted,",modern_nature
"Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.",modern_nature
See it come forth in blossom,modern_nature
From the snow-remembering heart,modern_nature
"In long-nighted January,",modern_nature
"In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.",modern_nature
Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane,modern_nature
"Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.",modern_nature
"Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom",modern_nature
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!,modern_nature
"Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,",modern_nature
"Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,",modern_nature
So that the faith in his heart smiles again,modern_nature
"And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,",modern_nature
"And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,",modern_nature
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud,modern_nature
"And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride",modern_nature
"A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,",modern_nature
"Frail-naked, utterly uncovered",modern_nature
"To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind",modern_nature
And January's loud-seeming sun.,modern_nature
"Think of it, from the iron fastness",modern_nature
"Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.",modern_nature
"Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,",modern_nature
"With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.",modern_nature
"Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,",modern_nature
"Come forth from iron,",modern_nature
Red your heart is.,modern_nature
"Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,",modern_nature
"More fearless than iron all the time,",modern_nature
"And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.",modern_nature
"In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,",modern_nature
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.,modern_nature
In the garden raying out,modern_nature
"With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about",modern_nature
"With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,",modern_nature
Sword-blade-born.,modern_nature
"Unpromised,",modern_nature
No bounds being set.,modern_nature
"Flaked out and come unpromised,",modern_nature
"The tree being life-divine,",modern_nature
"Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core",modern_nature
Within iron and earth.,modern_nature
"Knots of pink, fish-silvery",modern_nature
"In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,",modern_nature
"Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,",modern_nature
"Red at the core,",modern_nature
"Red at the core,",modern_nature
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.,modern_nature
"Open,",modern_nature
"Open,",modern_nature
"Five times wide open,",modern_nature
"Six times wide open,",modern_nature
"And given, and perfect;",modern_nature
"And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,",modern_nature
Sore-hearted-looking.,modern_nature
"At evening, sitting on this terrace,",modern_nature
"When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara",modern_nature
"Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...",modern_nature
When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing,modern_nature
Brown hills surrounding ...,modern_nature
When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio,modern_nature
"A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,",modern_nature
Against the current of obscure Arno ...,modern_nature
"Look up, and you see things flying",modern_nature
Between the day and the night;,modern_nature
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.,modern_nature
"A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches",modern_nature
Where light pushes through;,modern_nature
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.,modern_nature
A dip to the water.,modern_nature
And you think:,modern_nature
The swallows are flying so late!,modern_nature
Swallows?,modern_nature
Dark air-life looping,modern_nature
Yet missing the pure loop ...,modern_nature
"A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight",modern_nature
"And serrated wings against the sky,",modern_nature
"Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,",modern_nature
And falling back.,modern_nature
Never swallows!,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
The swallows are gone.,modern_nature
At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats,modern_nature
By the Ponte Vecchio ...,modern_nature
Changing guard.,modern_nature
"Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp",modern_nature
As the bats swoop overhead!,modern_nature
Flying madly.,modern_nature
Pipistrello!,modern_nature
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.,modern_nature
"Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;",modern_nature
Wings like bits of umbrella.,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
"Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;",modern_nature
And disgustingly upside down.,modern_nature
Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags,modern_nature
And grinning in their sleep.,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
In China the bat is symbol for happiness.,modern_nature
Not for me!Notes:,modern_nature
"Then you shall see her truly--your blood remembering its first invasion of her secrecy, its first encounters with her kind, her chieftain lover...his shade that haunts the lakes and hills",modern_nature
The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park,modern_nature
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling,modern_nature
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling,modern_nature
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by,modern_nature
I have seen the general dare the combers come closer,modern_nature
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.,modern_nature
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.,modern_nature
"Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.",modern_nature
"A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.",modern_nature
Not in that wasted garden,modern_nature
Where bodies are drawn into grass,modern_nature
"That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens",modern_nature
That bear no fruit ,modern_nature
There where along the shaded walks,modern_nature
"Vain sighs are heard,",modern_nature
And vainer dreams are dreamed,modern_nature
Of close communion with departed souls ,modern_nature
But here under the apple tree,modern_nature
I loved and watched and pruned,modern_nature
With gnarled hands,modern_nature
"In the long, long years;",modern_nature
Here under the roots of this northern-spy,modern_nature
"To move in the chemic change and circle of life,",modern_nature
"Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,",modern_nature
And into the living epitaphs,modern_nature
"Of redder apples!What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern_nature
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern_nature
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern_nature
To my heart's delight?,modern_nature
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern_nature
In the west I see a redness come,modern_nature
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern_nature
'Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern_nature
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern_nature
Calling low to her lover:,modern_nature
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern_nature
Has poised above her lips in play,modern_nature
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern_nature
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern_nature
" She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern_nature
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern_nature
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern_nature
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern_nature
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern_nature
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern_nature
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern_nature
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern_nature
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern_nature
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern_nature
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern_nature
"Her small head, making warm display",modern_nature
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern_nature
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern_nature
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern_nature
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern_nature
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern_nature
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern_nature
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern_nature
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern_nature
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern_nature
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern_nature
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern_nature
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern_nature
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern_nature
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern_nature
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern_nature
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern_nature
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern_nature
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern_nature
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern_nature
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern_nature
Should I not answer to his talk,modern_nature
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern_nature
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern_nature
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern_nature
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern_nature
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern_nature
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern_nature
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern_nature
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern_nature
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern_nature
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern_nature
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern_nature
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern_nature
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern_nature
I only know I let him finger there,modern_nature
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern_nature
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern_nature
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern_nature
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern_nature
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern_nature
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern_nature
"Within him, die, and find death good.",modern_nature
"See, the grass is full of stars,",modern_nature
Fallen in their brightness;,modern_nature
"Hearts they have of shining gold,",modern_nature
Rays of shining whiteness.,modern_nature
"Buttercups have honeyed hearts,",modern_nature
"Bees they love the clover,",modern_nature
But I love the daisies' dance,modern_nature
All the meadow over.,modern_nature
"Blow, O blow, you happy winds,",modern_nature
"Singing summer's praises,",modern_nature
Up the field and down the field,modern_nature
A-dancing with the daisies.,modern_nature
"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,",modern_nature
"Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,",modern_nature
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between,modern_nature
"Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.",modern_nature
"I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration",modern_nature
"Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze",modern_nature
"Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,",modern_nature
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.,modern_nature
"And I, what fountain of fire am I among",modern_nature
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed,modern_nature
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng,modern_nature
"Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.I never knew the earth had so much gold",modern_nature
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern_nature
"Hoary and old,",modern_nature
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern_nature
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern_nature
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern_nature
"This fringe of wood,",modern_nature
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern_nature
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern_nature
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern_nature
"You turned to me,",modern_nature
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern_nature
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern_nature
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern_nature
And you become,modern_nature
A goddess standing in a world of fire!The fog comes,modern_nature
on little cat feet.,modern_nature
It sits looking,modern_nature
over harbor and city,modern_nature
on silent haunches,modern_nature
and then moves on.,modern_nature
When she rises in the morning,modern_nature
I linger to watch her;,modern_nature
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern_nature
And the sunbeams catch her,modern_nature
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern_nature
While down her sides the mellow,modern_nature
Golden shadow glows as,modern_nature
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern_nature
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern_nature
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern_nature
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern_nature
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern_nature
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern_nature
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern_nature
In the window full of sunlight,modern_nature
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern_nature
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern_nature
"Mellow as the glory roses.Pray why are you so bare, so bare,",modern_nature
"Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;",modern_nature
"And why, when I go through the shade you throw,",modern_nature
Runs a shudder over me?,modern_nature
"My leaves were green as the best, I trow,",modern_nature
"And sap ran free in my veins,",modern_nature
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird,modern_nature
A guiltless victim's pains.,modern_nature
I bent me down to hear his sigh;,modern_nature
"I shook with his gurgling moan,",modern_nature
"And I trembled sore when they rode away,",modern_nature
And left him here alone.,modern_nature
"They'd charged him with the old, old crime,",modern_nature
And set him fast in jail:,modern_nature
"Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,",modern_nature
And why does the night wind wail?,modern_nature
"He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,",modern_nature
And he raised his hand to the sky;,modern_nature
"But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,",modern_nature
And the steady tread drew nigh.,modern_nature
"Who is it rides by night, by night,",modern_nature
Over the moonlit road?,modern_nature
"And what is the spur that keeps the pace,",modern_nature
What is the galling goad?,modern_nature
"And now they beat at the prison door,",modern_nature
"Ho, keeper, do not stay!",modern_nature
"We are friends of him whom you hold within,",modern_nature
And we fain would take him away,modern_nature
From those who ride fast on our heels,modern_nature
With mind to do him wrong;,modern_nature
"They have no care for his innocence,",modern_nature
And the rope they bear is long.,modern_nature
"They have fooled the jailer with lying words,",modern_nature
They have fooled the man with lies;,modern_nature
"The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,",modern_nature
And the great door open flies.,modern_nature
"Now they have taken him from the jail,",modern_nature
"And hard and fast they ride,",modern_nature
"And the leader laughs low down in his throat,",modern_nature
As they halt my trunk beside.,modern_nature
"Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,",modern_nature
"And the doctor one of white,",modern_nature
"And the minister, with his oldest son,",modern_nature
Was curiously bedight.,modern_nature
"Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?",modern_nature
"'Tis but a little space,",modern_nature
And the time will come when these shall dread,modern_nature
The mem'ry of your face.,modern_nature
"I feel the rope against my bark,",modern_nature
"And the weight of him in my grain,",modern_nature
I feel in the throe of his final woe,modern_nature
The touch of my own last pain.,modern_nature
And never more shall leaves come forth,modern_nature
On the bough that bears the ban;,modern_nature
"I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,",modern_nature
From the curse of a guiltless man.,modern_nature
"And ever the judge rides by, rides by,",modern_nature
"And goes to hunt the deer,",modern_nature
And ever another rides his soul,modern_nature
In the guise of a mortal fear.,modern_nature
"And ever the man he rides me hard,",modern_nature
And never a night stays he;,modern_nature
"For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,",modern_nature
On the trunk of a haunted tree.When I am dead and over me bright April,modern_nature
"Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,",modern_nature
"Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,",modern_nature
I shall not care.,modern_nature
"I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful",modern_nature
"When rain bends down the bough,",modern_nature
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted,modern_nature
Than you are now.in Just-,modern_nature
spring when the world is mud-,modern_nature
luscious the little,modern_nature
lame balloonman,modern_nature
whistles far and wee,modern_nature

and bettyandisbel come dancing,modern_nature
from hop-scotch and jump-rope and,modern_nature
it's spring and the goat-footed balloonMan whistles,modern_nature
"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,",modern_nature
"And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;",modern_nature
"Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,",modern_nature
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.,modern_nature
"And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,",modern_nature
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;,modern_nature
"There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,",modern_nature
And evening full of the linnets wings.,modern_nature
"I will arise and go now, for always night and day",modern_nature
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;,modern_nature
"While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,",modern_nature
I hear it in the deep hearts core.,modern_nature
little tree,modern_nature
little silent Christmas tree,modern_nature
you are so little,modern_nature
you are more like a flower,modern_nature
who found you in the green forest,modern_nature
and were you very sorry to come away?,modern_nature
see i will comfort you,modern_nature
because you smell so sweetly,modern_nature
i will kiss your cool bark,modern_nature
and hug you safe and tight,modern_nature
"just as your mother would,",modern_nature
only don't be afraid,modern_nature
look the spangles,modern_nature
that sleep all the year in a dark box,modern_nature
"dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,",modern_nature
"the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,",modern_nature
put up your little arms,modern_nature
and i'll give them all to you to hold,modern_nature
every finger shall have its ring,modern_nature
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy,modern_nature
then when you're quite dressed,modern_nature
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see,modern_nature
and how they'll stare!,modern_nature
oh but you'll be very proud,modern_nature
and my little sister and i will take hands,modern_nature
and looking up at our beautiful tree,modern_nature
we'll dance and sing,modern_nature
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern_nature
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern_nature
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern_nature
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern_nature
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern_nature
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern_nature
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern_nature
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern_nature
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern_nature
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern_nature
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern_nature
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern_nature
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern_nature
View of the river. And we strode,modern_nature
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern_nature
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern_nature
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern_nature
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern_nature
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern_nature
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern_nature
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern_nature
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern_nature
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern_nature
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern_nature
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern_nature
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern_nature
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern_nature
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern_nature
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern_nature
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern_nature
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern_nature
Motionless in the meadows,modern_nature
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern_nature
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern_nature
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern_nature
The tree-toads started ringing,modern_nature
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern_nature
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern_nature
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern_nature
The rivers tiny canon,modern_nature
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern_nature
Like a dark and silent companion,modern_nature
Evening held out her hands.,modern_nature
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern_nature
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern_nature
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern_nature
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern_nature
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern_nature
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern_nature
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern_nature
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern_nature
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern_nature
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern_nature
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern_nature
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern_nature
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern_nature
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern_nature
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern_nature
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern_nature
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern_nature
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern_nature
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern_nature
The woods became his background; every tree,modern_nature
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern_nature
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern_nature
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern_nature
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern_nature
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern_nature
With such a native element;,modern_nature
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern_nature
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern_nature
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern_nature
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern_nature
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern_nature
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page",modern_nature
"And still wing on, untarnished of the name",modern_nature
We pinion to your bodies to assuage,modern_nature
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim,modern_nature
"Because we are usurpers, and chagrined",modern_nature
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.,modern_nature
"Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;",modern_nature
"But we must die, as you, to understand.",modern_nature
"I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang",modern_nature
"As only they can praise, who build their days",modern_nature
"With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang",modern_nature
Struck free and holy in one Name always.,modern_nature
She has no need to fear the fall,modern_nature
Of harvest from the laddered reach,modern_nature
"Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing",modern_nature
From the steep beach.,modern_nature
Nor hold to pain's effrontery,modern_nature
"Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,",modern_nature
"Nor be a glass, where to forsee",modern_nature
Another's ravage.,modern_nature
"What she has gathered, and what lost,",modern_nature
She will not find to lose again.,modern_nature
"She is possessed by time, who once",modern_nature
Was loved by men.,modern_nature
The winter evening settles down,modern_nature
With smell of steaks in passageways.,modern_nature
Six oclock.,modern_nature
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.,modern_nature
And now a gusty shower wraps,modern_nature
The grimy scraps,modern_nature
Of withered leaves about your feet,modern_nature
And newspapers from vacant lots;,modern_nature
The showers beat,modern_nature
"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,",modern_nature
And at the corner of the street,modern_nature
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,modern_nature
And then the lighting of the lamps.,modern_nature
The morning comes to consciousness,modern_nature
Of faint stale smells of beer,modern_nature
From the sawdust-trampled street,modern_nature
With all its muddy feet that press,modern_nature
To early coffee-stands.,modern_nature
With the other masquerades,modern_nature
"That time resumes,",modern_nature
One thinks of all the hands,modern_nature
That are raising dingy shades,modern_nature
In a thousand furnished rooms.,modern_nature
"You tossed a blanket from the bed,",modern_nature
"You lay upon your back, and waited;",modern_nature
"You dozed, and watched the night revealing",modern_nature
The thousand sordid images,modern_nature
Of which your soul was constituted;,modern_nature
They flickered against the ceiling.,modern_nature
And when all the world came back,modern_nature
And the light crept up between the shutters,modern_nature
"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,",modern_nature
You had such a vision of the street,modern_nature
As the street hardly understands;,modern_nature
"Sitting along the beds edge, where",modern_nature
"You curled the papers from your hair,",modern_nature
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet,modern_nature
In the palms of both soiled hands.,modern_nature
His soul stretched tight across the skies,modern_nature
"That fade behind a city block,",modern_nature
Or trampled by insistent feet,modern_nature
At four and five and six oclock;,modern_nature
"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,",modern_nature
"And evening newspapers, and eyes",modern_nature
"Assured of certain certainties,",modern_nature
The conscience of a blackened street,modern_nature
Impatient to assume the world.,modern_nature
I am moved by fancies that are curled,modern_nature
"Around these images, and cling:",modern_nature
The notion of some infinitely gentle,modern_nature
Infinitely suffering thing.,modern_nature
"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;",modern_nature
The worlds revolve like ancient women,modern_nature
"Gathering fuel in vacant lots.The willows carried a slow sound,",modern_nature
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.,modern_nature
I could never remember,modern_nature
"That seething, steady leveling of the marshes",modern_nature
Till age had brought me to the sea.,modern_nature
"Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves",modern_nature
Where cypresses shared the noons,modern_nature
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.,modern_nature
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams,modern_nature
"Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them",modern_nature
Asunder ...,modern_nature
How much I would have bartered! the black gorge,modern_nature
And all the singular nestings in the hills,modern_nature
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.,modern_nature
The pond I entered once and quickly fled,modern_nature
I remember now its singing willow rim.,modern_nature
"And finally, in that memory all things nurse;",modern_nature
After the city that I finally passed,modern_nature
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts,modern_nature
The monsoon cut across the delta,modern_nature
"At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes",modern_nature
"I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,",modern_nature
And willows could not hold more steady sound.Twelve o'clock.,modern_nature
Along the reaches of the street,modern_nature
"Held in a lunar synthesis,",modern_nature
Whispering lunar incantations,modern_nature
Dissolve the floors of memory,modern_nature
"And all its clear relations,",modern_nature
"Its divisions and precisions,",modern_nature
Every street lamp that I pass,modern_nature
"Beats like a fatalistic drum,",modern_nature
And through the spaces of the dark,modern_nature
Midnight shakes the memory,modern_nature
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.,modern_nature
"Half-past one,",modern_nature
"The street lamp sputtered,",modern_nature
"The street lamp muttered,",modern_nature
"The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman",modern_nature
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door,modern_nature
Which opens on her like a grin.,modern_nature
You see the border of her dress,modern_nature
"Is torn and stained with sand,",modern_nature
And you see the corner of her eye,modern_nature
"Twists like a crooked pin.""",modern_nature
The memory throws up high and dry,modern_nature
A crowd of twisted things;,modern_nature
A twisted branch upon the beach,modern_nature
"Eaten smooth, and polished",modern_nature
As if the world gave up,modern_nature
"The secret of its skeleton,",modern_nature
Stiff and white.,modern_nature
"A broken spring in a factory yard,",modern_nature
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left,modern_nature
Hard and curled and ready to snap.,modern_nature
"Half-past two,",modern_nature
"The street lamp said,",modern_nature
"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.",modern_nature
"So the hand of a child, automatic,",modern_nature
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.,modern_nature
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.,modern_nature
I have seen eyes in the street,modern_nature
"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,",modern_nature
"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,",modern_nature
"An old crab with barnacles on his back,",modern_nature
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.,modern_nature
"Half-past three,",modern_nature
"The lamp sputtered,",modern_nature
The lamp muttered in the dark.,modern_nature
The lamp hummed:,modern_nature
Regard the moon,modern_nature
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,modern_nature
She winks a feeble eye,modern_nature
She smiles into corners.,modern_nature
She smoothes the hair of the grass.,modern_nature
The moon has lost her memory.,modern_nature
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,modern_nature
Her hand twists a paper rose,modern_nature
That smells of dust and old Cologne,modern_nature
She is alone,modern_nature
With all the old nocturnal smells,modern_nature
That cross and cross across her brain.,modern_nature
The reminiscence comes,modern_nature
Of sunless dry geraniums,modern_nature
"And dust in crevices,",modern_nature
"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,",modern_nature
"And female smells in shuttered rooms,",modern_nature
And cigarettes in corridors,modern_nature
"And cocktail smells in bars.""",modern_nature
"The lamp said,",modern_nature
"Four o'clock,",modern_nature
Here is the number on the door.,modern_nature
Memory!,modern_nature
"You have the key,",modern_nature
"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,",modern_nature
Mount.,modern_nature
"The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,",modern_nature
"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.",modern_nature
The last twist of the knife.,modern_nature
"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,",modern_nature
"Out of the loud foam,",modern_nature
He has put in to a great quiet,modern_nature
And a still home.,modern_nature
Here he may lie at ease and wonder,modern_nature
"Why the old ship waits,",modern_nature
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder,modern_nature
"Of the full Straits,",modern_nature
"And look for the fishing fleet at morning,",modern_nature
"Shadows like lost souls,",modern_nature
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning,modern_nature
"Betrays the shoals,",modern_nature
And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing,modern_nature
"Out of the bright West,",modern_nature
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining,modern_nature
"Like a tern's breast, ",modern_nature
And never know he is done for ever,modern_nature
"With the old sea's pride,",modern_nature
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour,modern_nature

Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern_nature

Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head,modern_nature

My feet were by frost benumbed.,modern_nature
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs,modern_nature

On the last of October,modern_nature
When dusk is fallen,modern_nature
Children join hands,modern_nature

Singing ghost songs,modern_nature

I am a jack-o'-lantern,modern_nature
With terrible teeth,modern_nature

I am fooling.Green miles of leafy peace are spread,modern_nature

Screening the trenches with their dead,modern_nature

As though it were a comrade slain;,modern_nature
Each was a shelter from the eyes,modern_nature

The huge artillery of the storm,modern_nature
Plows through the land and pulls it under.,modern_nature

"Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I",modern_nature
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.,modern_nature
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern_nature
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern_nature
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern_nature
"Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.",modern_nature
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern_nature
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,",modern_nature

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?,modern_nature
"Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!",modern_nature
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed,modern_nature

"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,",modern_nature
"Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,",modern_nature
"Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.",modern_nature

Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;,modern_nature
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",modern_nature
"They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.",modern_nature
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",modern_nature
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.,modern_nature
"Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I",modern_nature
"Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!",modern_nature
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern_nature
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern_nature
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern_nature

"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern_nature
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;",modern_nature
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",modern_nature
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,modern_nature
"What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?",modern_nature
"What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?",modern_nature
What is this thing that I look down upon?,modern_nature
"White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.",modern_nature
"How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!",modern_nature
"I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!",modern_nature
"And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,",modern_nature
"And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.",modern_nature
"But how splendid it is to be substance, here!",modern_nature
"My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!",modern_nature
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!,modern_nature
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.,modern_nature
"Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air",modern_nature
"Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",modern_nature
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere,modern_nature
"We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!",modern_nature
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",modern_nature
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!",modern_nature
No longer shadow!  and it holds me,modern_nature
"Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.",modern_nature
"Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!",modern_nature
"Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!",modern_nature
"All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs",modern_nature
"In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.The trees are in their autumn beauty,",modern_nature
"The woodland paths are dry,",modern_nature
Under the October twilight the water,modern_nature
Mirrors a still sky;,modern_nature
Upon the brimming water among the stones,modern_nature
Are nine-and-fifty swans.,modern_nature
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me,modern_nature
Since I first made my count;,modern_nature
"I saw, before I had well finished,",modern_nature
All suddenly mount,modern_nature
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings,modern_nature
Upon their clamorous wings.,modern_nature
"I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,",modern_nature
And now my heart is sore.,modern_nature
"All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,",modern_nature
"The first time on this shore,",modern_nature
"The bell-beat of their wings above my head,",modern_nature
Trod with a lighter tread.,modern_nature
"Unwearied still, lover by lover,",modern_nature
They paddle in the cold,modern_nature
Companionable streams or climb the air;,modern_nature
Their hearts have not grown old;,modern_nature
"Passion or conquest, wander where they will,",modern_nature
Attend upon them still.,modern_nature
"But now they drift on the still water,",modern_nature
"Mysterious, beautiful;",modern_nature
"Among what rushes will they build,",modern_nature
By what lake's edge or pool,modern_nature
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day,modern_nature
"To find they have flown away?Give me hunger,",modern_nature
O you gods that sit and give,modern_nature
The world its orders.,modern_nature
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern_nature
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern_nature
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern_nature
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern_nature
"But leave me a little love,",modern_nature
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern_nature
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern_nature
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern_nature
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern_nature
"Blurring the sunset,",modern_nature
"One little wandering, western star",modern_nature
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern_nature
"Let me go to the window,",modern_nature
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern_nature
And wait and know the coming,modern_nature
"Of a little love.Passing through huddled and ugly walls,",modern_nature
By doorways where women haggard,modern_nature
"Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,",modern_nature
"Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,",modern_nature
"Out from the huddled and ugly walls,",modern_nature
"I came sudden, at the city's edge,",modern_nature
"On a blue burst of lake,",modern_nature
Long lake waves breaking under the sun,modern_nature
On a spray-flung curve of shore;,modern_nature
"And a fluttering storm of gulls,",modern_nature
Masses of great gray wings,modern_nature
And flying white bellies,modern_nature
Veering and wheeling free in the open.Desolate and lone,modern_nature
All night long on the lake,modern_nature
"Where fog trails and mist creeps,",modern_nature
The whistle of a boat,modern_nature
"Calls and cries unendingly,",modern_nature
Like some lost child,modern_nature
In tears and trouble,modern_nature
Hunting the harbor's breast,modern_nature
"And the harbor's eyes.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern_nature
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern_nature
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern_nature
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern_nature
"Yes, Momus,",modern_nature
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern_nature
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern_nature
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern_nature
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern_nature
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern_nature
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern_nature
"I wonder, Momus,",modern_nature
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,modern_nature
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",modern_nature
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",modern_nature
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",modern_nature
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",modern_nature
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,modern_nature
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",modern_nature
And blood drops of undiminishing war.I shall foot it,modern_nature
"Down the roadway in the dusk,",modern_nature
Where shapes of hunger wander,modern_nature
And the fugitives of pain go by.,modern_nature
I shall foot it,modern_nature
"In the silence of the morning,",modern_nature
"See the night slur into dawn,",modern_nature
Hear the slow great winds arise,modern_nature
Where tall trees flank the way,modern_nature
And shoulder toward the sky.,modern_nature
The broken boulders by the road,modern_nature
Shall not commemorate my ruin.,modern_nature
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.,modern_nature
I shall watch for,modern_nature
Slim birds swift of wing,modern_nature
That go where wind and ranks of thunder,modern_nature
Drive the wild processionals of rain.,modern_nature
The dust of the travelled road,modern_nature
"Shall touch my hands and face.I have sat here happy in the gardens,",modern_nature
Watching the still pool and the reeds,modern_nature
And the dark clouds,modern_nature
Which the wind of the upper air,modern_nature
Tore like the green leafy boughs,modern_nature
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;,modern_nature
But though I greatly delight,modern_nature
"In these and the water-lilies,",modern_nature
That which sets me nighest to weeping,modern_nature
"Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,",modern_nature
And the pale yellow grasses,modern_nature
"Among them.Potuia, potuia",modern_nature
"White grave goddess,",modern_nature
"Pity my sadness,",modern_nature
O silence of Paros.,modern_nature
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern_nature
These garments and decorum;,modern_nature
"I am thy brother,",modern_nature
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern_nature
And thou hearest me not.,modern_nature
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern_nature
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern_nature
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern_nature
When the fragile pipes,modern_nature
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern_nature
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern_nature
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern_nature
And only the cicada sang.,modern_nature
I have told thee of the hills,modern_nature
And the lisp of reeds,modern_nature
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern_nature
"And thou hearest me not,",modern_nature
"Potuia, potuia",modern_nature
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,modern_nature
Pass deathward mournfully.,modern_nature
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",modern_nature
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",modern_nature
Symbols of ancient songs,modern_nature
Mournfully passing,modern_nature
"Down to the great white surges,",modern_nature
Watched of none         - -,modern_nature
Save the frail sea-birds,modern_nature
"And the lithe pale girls,",modern_nature
Daughters of Okeanos.,modern_nature
And the songs pass,modern_nature
From the green land,modern_nature
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,modern_nature
On the flowers of hyacinth;,modern_nature
"And they pass from the waters,",modern_nature
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",modern_nature
"And they come,",modern_nature
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",modern_nature
To the quiet level lands,modern_nature
"That she keeps for us all,",modern_nature
That she wrought for us all for sleep,modern_nature
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,modern_nature
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",modern_nature
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",modern_nature
"And we turn from thee,",modern_nature
"Phoibos Apollon,",modern_nature
And we turn from the music of old,modern_nature
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",modern_nature
"And we turn from the fiery day,",modern_nature
And the lips that were over-sweet;,modern_nature
For silently,modern_nature
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",modern_nature
With purple robe,modern_nature
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
Thou hast come upon us.,modern_nature
And of all the ancient songs,modern_nature
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,modern_nature
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",modern_nature
This only remains:,modern_nature
"That in the end we turn to thee,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
"That we turn to thee, singing",modern_nature
One last song.,modern_nature
"O Death,",modern_nature
Thou art an healing wind,modern_nature
That blowest over white flowers,modern_nature
A-tremble with dew;,modern_nature
Thou art a wind flowing,modern_nature
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,modern_nature
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,modern_nature
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,modern_nature
Thou art the pale peace of one,modern_nature
Satiate with old desires;,modern_nature
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",modern_nature
And we look no more for the morning;,modern_nature
"We yearn no more for the sun,",modern_nature
"Since with thy white hands,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",modern_nature
The slim colorless poppies,modern_nature
Which in thy garden alone,modern_nature
Softly thou gatherest.,modern_nature
And silently;,modern_nature
And with slow feet approaching;,modern_nature
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",modern_nature
We kneel before thee:,modern_nature
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",modern_nature
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",modern_nature
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",modern_nature
Thou sealest our eyes,modern_nature
And the illimitable quietude,modern_nature
Comes gently upon us.,modern_nature
