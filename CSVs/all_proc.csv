The day before Curl Trenary,modern_love
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,modern_love
For stealing hogs.,modern_love
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,modern_love
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,modern_love
We quarreled and I told him never again,modern_love
To cross my path.,modern_love
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,modern_love
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,modern_love
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,modern_love
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",modern_love
But only tried to help her.,modern_love
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,modern_love
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",modern_love
He had broken the law human and divine.,modern_love
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",modern_love
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",modern_love
"And all your pathways peace,",modern_love
Love God and keep his commandments.,modern_love
"And lights were paling out of the West,",modern_love
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",modern_love
And I would lay my head on your breast;,modern_love
"And you would murmur tender words,",modern_love
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",modern_love
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",modern_love
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",modern_love
But know your hair was bound and wound,modern_love
About the stars and moon and sun:,modern_love
"O would, beloved, that you lay",modern_love
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",modern_love
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",modern_love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,modern_love
To passionate women if it seem,modern_love
"Certain, and they never dream",modern_love
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,modern_love
For everything thats lovely is,modern_love
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",modern_love
"O never give the heart outright,",modern_love
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",modern_love
Have given their hearts up to the play.,modern_love
And who could play it well enough,modern_love
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,modern_love
"He that made this knows all the cost,",modern_love
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_love
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_love
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_love
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_love
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_love
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_love
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_love
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_love
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_love
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_love
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_love
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,modern_love
The verses that could move them on the day,modern_love
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",modern_love
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",modern_love
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",modern_love
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",modern_love
That were like memories of youbut now,modern_love
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",modern_love
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",modern_love
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",modern_love
"But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,",modern_love
"My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone. Shy one, shy one,",modern_love
"Shy one of my heart,",modern_love
She moves in the firelight,modern_love
Pensively apart.,modern_love
"She carries in the dishes,",modern_love
And lays them in a row.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
With her would I go.,modern_love
"She carries in the candles,",modern_love
"And lights the curtained room,",modern_love
Shy in the doorway,modern_love
And shy in the gloom;,modern_love
"And shy as a rabbit,",modern_love
Helpful and shy.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
"With her would I fly.I feel the spring far off, far off,",modern_love
"The faint, far scent of bud and leaf",modern_love
"Oh, how can spring take heart to come",modern_love
"To a world in grief,",modern_love
Deep grief?,modern_love
"The sun turns north, the days grow long,",modern_love
Later the evening star grows bright,modern_love
How can the daylight linger on,modern_love
"For men to fight,",modern_love
Still fight?,modern_love
"The grass is waking in the ground,",modern_love
Soon it will rise and blow in waves,modern_love
How can it have the heart to sway,modern_love
"Over the graves,",modern_love
New graves?,modern_love
Under the boughs where lovers walked,modern_love
The apple-blooms will shed their breath,modern_love
But what of all the lovers now,modern_love
"Parted by Death,",modern_love
"Grey Death?Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;",modern_love
Watching the candle guttering in the draught;,modern_love
"Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily",modern_love
"Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed",modern_love
"With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,",modern_love
"All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;",modern_love
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;,modern_love
"Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,",modern_love
"Though in a picture only, a common cheap",modern_love
"Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some",modern_love
waiting on Dicky-bird to peep,modern_love
Out of the handkerchief that is his home,modern_love
"But he's so shy! And some with bright looks, calling",modern_love
"Delight across the miles of land and sea,",modern_love
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling,modern_love
Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.,modern_love
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O,modern_love
"The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! ",modern_love
"Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow",modern_love
"Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.",modern_love
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token,modern_love
"Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,",modern_love
"Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,",modern_love
"A girl who better had not been beloved.I went out to the hazel wood,",modern_love
"Because a fire was in my head,",modern_love
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",modern_love
And hooked a berry to a thread;,modern_love
"And when white moths were on the wing,",modern_love
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",modern_love
I dropped the berry in a stream,modern_love
And caught a little silver trout.,modern_love
When I had laid it on the floor,modern_love
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",modern_love
"But something rustled on the floor,",modern_love
And someone called me by my name:,modern_love
It had become a glimmering girl,modern_love
With apple blossom in her hair,modern_love
Who called me by my name and ran,modern_love
And faded through the brightening air.,modern_love
Though I am old with wandering,modern_love
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",modern_love
"I will find out where she has gone,",modern_love
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,modern_love
"And walk among long dappled grass,",modern_love
"And pluck till time and times are done,",modern_love
"The silver apples of the moon,",modern_love
The golden apples of the sun.Now that I know,modern_love
That passion warms little,modern_love
"Of flesh in the mold,",modern_love
"And treasure is brittle,",modern_love
Ill lie here and learn,modern_love
"How, over their ground,",modern_love
Trees make a long shadow,modern_love
And a light sound.,modern_love
"The stars are hiding now,",modern_love
"And frowning on the world, love,",modern_love
Night bares her sable brow.,modern_love
"The snow is on the ground, love,",modern_love
And cold and keen the air is.,modern_love
"Im singing here to you, love;",modern_love
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,modern_love
"But this is Natures law, love,",modern_love
"Though just it may not seem,",modern_love
"That men should wake to sing, love;",modern_love
While maidens sleep and dream.,modern_love
"Them care may not molest, love,",modern_love
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",modern_love
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",modern_love
Still halting oer his numbers.,modern_love
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",modern_love
"Come stealing up the east,",modern_love
"While all things round rejoice, love,",modern_love
That Night her reign has ceased.,modern_love
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",modern_love
And on his way be winging;,modern_love
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",modern_love
"Why should a man be singing?Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,",modern_love
My being is attuned to thee.,modern_love
"Thou settest all my words a-wing,",modern_love
And meltest me to melody.,modern_love
"Thou art my life, by thee I live,",modern_love
From thee proceed the joys I know;,modern_love
"Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give",modern_love
The meed of lovethe cup of woe.,modern_love
"Thou art my love, by thee I lead",modern_love
"My soul the paths of light along,",modern_love
"From vale to vale, from mead to mead,",modern_love
And home it in the hills of song.,modern_love
"My song, my soul, my life, my all,",modern_love
"Why need I pray or make my plea,",modern_love
Since my petition cannot fall;,modern_love
For Im already one with thee!Wine comes in at the mouth,modern_love
And love comes in at the eye;,modern_love
Thats all we shall know for truth,modern_love
Before we grow old and die.,modern_love
"I lift the glass to my mouth,",modern_love
"I look at you, and I sigh.Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.",modern_love
I saw nothing of you anywhere.,modern_love
"I was at the old place and the other girls were there,",modern_love
But no Bilbea.,modern_love
Have you gone to another house? or city?,modern_love
Why dont you write?,modern_love
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.,modern_love
Tell me how it goes.,modern_love
Send me some kind of a letter.,modern_love
"And take care of yourself.How much do you love me, a million bushels?",modern_love
"Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.",modern_love
And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?,modern_love
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.,modern_love
And is this your heart arithmetic?,modern_love
This is the way the wind measures the weather.,modern_love
When the world turns completely upside down,modern_love
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore,modern_love
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;,modern_love
"Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,",modern_love
"Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown",modern_love
"Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.",modern_love
"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,",modern_love
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.,modern_love
"The winter will be short, the summer long,",modern_love
"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,",modern_love
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;,modern_love
"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.",modern_love
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall,modern_love
"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.",modern_love
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass,modern_love
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.,modern_love
The misted early mornings will be cold;,modern_love
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.,modern_love
"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,",modern_love
"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold",modern_love
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,modern_love
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.,modern_love
"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;",modern_love
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;,modern_love
The spring begins before the winters over.,modern_love
By February you may find the skins,modern_love
Of garter snakes and water moccasins,modern_love
"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.",modern_love
When April pours the colors of a shell,modern_love
"Upon the hills, when every little creek",modern_love
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake,modern_love
"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,",modern_love
"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek",modern_love
"Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,",modern_love
We shall live well  we shall live very well.,modern_love
The months between the cherries and the peaches,modern_love
Are brimming cornucopias which spill,modern_love
"Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;",modern_love
"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches",modern_love
"Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill",modern_love
"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.",modern_love
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones,modern_love
Theres something in this richness that I hate.,modern_love
"I love the look, austere, immaculate,",modern_love
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.,modern_love
Theres something in my very blood that owns,modern_love
"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,",modern_love
"A thread of water, churned to milky spate",modern_love
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.,modern_love
"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,",modern_love
"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;",modern_love
"That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,",modern_love
"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,",modern_love
"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,",modern_love
"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",modern_love
"The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant.We sat together at one summers end,",modern_love
"That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   ",modern_love
"And you and I, and talked of poetry.",modern_love
"I said, A line will take us hours maybe;",modern_love
"Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   ",modern_love
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   ,modern_love
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   ,modern_love
"And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   ",modern_love
"Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   ",modern_love
For to articulate sweet sounds together,modern_love
"Is to work harder than all these, and yet   ",modern_love
Be thought an idler by the noisy set,modern_love
"Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   ",modern_love
The martyrs call the world.,modern_love
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   ,modern_love
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   ,modern_love
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   ,modern_love
"Replied, To be born woman is to know",modern_love
Although they do not talk of it at school,modern_love
That we must labour to be beautiful.,modern_love
"I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   ",modern_love
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.,modern_love
There have been lovers who thought love should be   ,modern_love
So much compounded of high courtesy   ,modern_love
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   ,modern_love
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   ,modern_love
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.,modern_love
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   ,modern_love
"We saw the last embers of daylight die,   ",modern_love
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   ,modern_love
"A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   ",modern_love
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   ,modern_love
About the stars and broke in days and years.,modern_love
I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   ,modern_love
"That you were beautiful, and that I strove   ",modern_love
To love you in the old high way of love;,modern_love
"That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   ",modern_love
"As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,",modern_love
"No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone",modern_love
The Southern Cross takes night,modern_love
"And lifts her girdles from her, one by one",modern_love
"High, cool,",modern_love
wide from the slowly smoldering fire,modern_love
"Of lower heavens,",modern_love
vaporous scars!,modern_love
Eve! Magdalene!,modern_love
"or Mary, you?",modern_love
Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.,modern_love
"O simian Venus, homeless Eve,",modern_love
"Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve",modern_love
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;,modern_love
Finally to answer all within one grave!,modern_love
"And this long wake of phosphor,",modern_love
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,modern_love
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,modern_love
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,modern_love
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",modern_love
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,modern_love
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,modern_love
It is blood to remember; it is fire,modern_love
To stammer back . . . It is,modern_love
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,modern_love
All night the water combed you with black,modern_love
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",modern_love
"Water rattled that stinging coil, your",modern_love
"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",modern_love
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",modern_love
"The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.",modern_love
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,modern_love
my love and I did meet;,modern_love
She passed the salley gardens,modern_love
with little snow-white feet.,modern_love
"She bid me take love easy,",modern_love
as the leaves grow on the tree;,modern_love
"But I, being young and foolish,",modern_love
with her would not agree.,modern_love
In a field by the river,modern_love
"my love and I did stand,",modern_love
And on my leaning shoulder,modern_love
she laid her snow-white hand.,modern_love
"She bid me take life easy,",modern_love
as the grass grows on the weirs;,modern_love
"But I was young and foolish,",modern_love
and now am full of tears.,modern_love
"You dweller in the dark cabin,",modern_love
"To whom the watermelon is always purple,   ",modern_love
"Whose garden is wind and moon,",modern_love
"Of the two dreams, night and day,",modern_love
"What lover, what dreamer, would choose   ",modern_love
The one obscured by sleep?,modern_love
Here is the plantain by your door   ,modern_love
And the best cock of red feather   ,modern_love
That crew before the clocks.,modern_love
"A feme may come, leaf-green,   ",modern_love
Whose coming may give revel   ,modern_love
"Beyond revelries of sleep,",modern_love
"Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   ",modern_love
"So that the sun may speckle,   ",modern_love
While it creaks hail.,modern_love
"You dweller in the dark cabin,   ",modern_love
"Rise, since rising will not waken,   ",modern_love
"And hail, cry hail, cry hail.",modern_love
Come when the nights are bright with stars,modern_love
Or come when the moon is mellow;,modern_love
Come when the sun his golden bars,modern_love
Drops on the hay-field yellow.,modern_love
"Come in the twilight soft and gray,",modern_love
"Come in the night or come in the day,",modern_love
"Come, O love, wheneer you may,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
"You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",modern_love
You are soft as the nesting dove.,modern_love
Come to my heart and bring it to rest,modern_love
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.,modern_love
Come when my heart is full of grief,modern_love
Or when my heart is merry;,modern_love
Come with the falling of the leaf,modern_love
Or with the reddning cherry.,modern_love
"Come when the years first blossom blows,",modern_love
"Come when the summer gleams and glows,",modern_love
"Come with the winters drifting snows,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,modern_love
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",modern_love
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",modern_love
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",modern_love
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,modern_love
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",modern_love
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,modern_love
"I never laughed, being bashful.",modern_love
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",modern_love
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",modern_love
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",modern_love
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,modern_love
"Forever and forever, and forever.",modern_love
Why should I climb the look out?,modern_love
At sixteen you departed,modern_love
"You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,",modern_love
And you have been gone five months.,modern_love
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,modern_love
You dragged your feet when you went out.,modern_love
"By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,",modern_love
Too deep to clear them away!,modern_love
"The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.",modern_love
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August,modern_love
Over the grass in the West garden;,modern_love
They hurt me.,modern_love
I grow older.,modern_love
"If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,",modern_love
"Please let me know beforehand,",modern_love
And I will come out to meet you,modern_love
"As far as Cho-fu-Sa.Since there is no escape, since at the end",modern_love
"My body will be utterly destroyed,",modern_love
"This hand I love as I have loved a friend,",modern_love
"This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;",modern_love
Since there is no escape even for me,modern_love
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:,modern_love
"The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea",modern_love
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,modern_love
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",modern_love
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,modern_love
"In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;",modern_love
In these few hours of light I lift my head;,modern_love
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,modern_love
If there is any way to baffle death.,modern_love
"Too high, too high to pluck",modern_love
My heart shall swing.,modern_love
"A fruit no bee shall suck,",modern_love
No wasp shall sting.,modern_love
If on some night of cold,modern_love
It falls to ground,modern_love
In apple-leaves of gold,modern_love
Ill wrap it round.,modern_love
And I shall seal it up,modern_love
"With spice and salt,",modern_love
"In a carven silver cup,",modern_love
In a deep vault.,modern_love
Before my eyes are blind,modern_love
"And my lips mute,",modern_love
I must eat core and rind,modern_love
Of that same fruit.,modern_love
Before my heart is dust,modern_love
"At the end of all,",modern_love
"Eat it I must, I must",modern_love
Were it bitter gall.,modern_love
But I shall keep it sweet,modern_love
By some strange art;,modern_love
Wild honey I shall eat,modern_love
When I eat my heart.,modern_love
O honey cool and chaste,modern_love
As clovers breath!,modern_love
Sweet Heaven I shall taste,modern_love
Before my death.When the first dark had fallen around them,modern_love
"And the leaves were weary of praise,",modern_love
In the clear silence Beauty found them,modern_love
And shewed them all her ways.,modern_love
In the high noon of the heavenly garden,modern_love
"Where the angels sunned with the birds,",modern_love
"Beauty, before their hearts could harden,",modern_love
Had taught them heavenly words.,modern_love
When they fled in the burning weather,modern_love
"And nothing dawned but a dream,",modern_love
Beauty fasted their hands together,modern_love
And cooled them at her stream.,modern_love
"And when day wearied and night grew stronger,",modern_love
"And they slept as the beautiful must,",modern_love
"Then she bided a little longer,",modern_love
"And blossomed from their dust.My love looks like a girl to-night,",modern_love
But she is old.,modern_love
The plaits that lie along her pillow,modern_love
"Are not gold,",modern_love
"But threaded with filigree silver,",modern_love
And uncanny cold.,modern_love
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",modern_love
"Is smooth and fair,",modern_love
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",modern_love
She sleeps a rare,modern_love
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",modern_love
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",modern_love
Of perfect things.,modern_love
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",modern_love
And her dead mouth sings,modern_love
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.The jester walked in the garden:",modern_love
The garden had fallen still;,modern_love
He bade his soul rise upward,modern_love
And stand on her window-sill.,modern_love
"It rose in a straight blue garment,",modern_love
When owls began to call:,modern_love
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking,modern_love
Of a quiet and light footfall;,modern_love
But the young queen would not listen;,modern_love
She rose in her pale night-gown;,modern_love
She drew in the heavy casement,modern_love
And pushed the latches down.,modern_love
"He bade his heart go to her,",modern_love
When the owls called out no more;,modern_love
In a red and quivering garment,modern_love
It sang to her through the door.,modern_love
It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming,modern_love
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;,modern_love
But she took up her fan from the table,modern_love
And waved it off on the air.,modern_love
"'I have cap and bells, he pondered,",modern_love
'I will send them to her and die;,modern_love
And when the morning whitened,modern_love
He left them where she went by.,modern_love
"She laid them upon her bosom,",modern_love
"Under a cloud of her hair,",modern_love
And her red lips sang them a love-song,modern_love
Till stars grew out of the air.,modern_love
"She opened her door and her window,",modern_love
"And the heart and the soul came through,",modern_love
"To her right hand came the red one,",modern_love
To her left hand came the blue.,modern_love
"They set up a noise like crickets,",modern_love
"A chattering wise and sweet,",modern_love
And her hair was a folded flower,modern_love
"And the quiet of love in her feet.What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern_love
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern_love
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern_love
To my heart's delight?,modern_love
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern_love
In the west I see a redness come,modern_love
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern_love
Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern_love
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern_love
Calling low to her lover:,modern_love
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern_love
Has poised above her lips in play,modern_love
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern_love
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern_love
"She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern_love
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern_love
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern_love
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern_love
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern_love
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern_love
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern_love
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern_love
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern_love
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern_love
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern_love
"Her small head, making warm display",modern_love
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern_love
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern_love
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern_love
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern_love
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern_love
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern_love
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern_love
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern_love
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern_love
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern_love
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern_love
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern_love
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern_love
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern_love
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern_love
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern_love
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern_love
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern_love
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern_love
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern_love
Should I not answer to his talk,modern_love
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern_love
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern_love
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern_love
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern_love
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern_love
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern_love
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern_love
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern_love
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern_love
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern_love
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern_love
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern_love
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern_love
I only know I let him finger there,modern_love
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern_love
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern_love
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern_love
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern_love
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern_love
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern_love
"Within him, die, and find death good.Supper comes at five o'clock,",modern_love
"At six, the evening star,",modern_love
My lover comes at eight o'clock,modern_love
But eight o'clock is far.,modern_love
How could I bear my pain all day,modern_love
Unless I watched to see,modern_love
The clock-hands laboring to bring,modern_love
"Eight o'clock to me.Go, dumb-born book,",modern_love
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:,modern_love
Hadst thou but song,modern_love
"As thou hast subjects known,",modern_love
Then were there cause in thee that should condone,modern_love
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie,modern_love
And build her glories their longevity.,modern_love
Tell her that sheds,modern_love
"Such treasure in the air,",modern_love
Recking naught else but that her graces give,modern_love
"Life to the moment,",modern_love
I would bid them live,modern_love
"As roses might, in magic amber laid,",modern_love
Red overwrought with orange and all made,modern_love
One substance and one colour,modern_love
Braving time.,modern_love
Tell her that goes,modern_love
With song upon her lips,modern_love
"But sings not out the song, nor knows",modern_love
"The maker of it, some other mouth,",modern_love
"May be as fair as hers,",modern_love
"Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,",modern_love
"When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,",modern_love
"Siftings on siftings in oblivion,",modern_love
Till change hath broken down,modern_love
"All things save Beauty alone.They came to tell your faults to me,",modern_love
They named them over one by one;,modern_love
"I laughed aloud when they were done,",modern_love
"I knew them all so well before, ",modern_love
"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see",modern_love
Your faults had made me love you more.I never knew the earth had so much gold,modern_love
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern_love
"Hoary and old,",modern_love
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern_love
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern_love
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern_love
"This fringe of wood,",modern_love
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern_love
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern_love
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern_love
"You turned to me,",modern_love
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern_love
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern_love
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern_love
And you become,modern_love
A goddess standing in a world of fire!When she rises in the morning,modern_love
I linger to watch her;,modern_love
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern_love
And the sunbeams catch her,modern_love
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern_love
While down her sides the mellow,modern_love
Golden shadow glows as,modern_love
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern_love
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern_love
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern_love
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern_love
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern_love
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern_love
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern_love
In the window full of sunlight,modern_love
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern_love
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern_love
Mellow as the glory roses.,modern_love
"Yours is the shame and sorrow,",modern_love
But the disgrace is mine;,modern_love
"Your love was dark and thorough,",modern_love
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower,modern_love
He creates with his shine.,modern_love
"I was diligent to explore you,",modern_love
"Blossom you stalk by stalk,",modern_love
Till my fire of creation bore you,modern_love
Shrivelling down in the final dour,modern_love
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.,modern_love
"I knew your pain, and it broke",modern_love
"My fine, craftsman's nerve;",modern_love
"Your body quailed at my stroke,",modern_love
And my courage failed to give you the last,modern_love
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern_love
"You are shapely, you are adorned,",modern_love
"But opaque and dull in the flesh,",modern_love
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern_love
"Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast",modern_love
In a lovely illumined mesh.,modern_love
Like a painted window: the best,modern_love
"Suffering burnt through your flesh,",modern_love
Undrossed it and left it blest,modern_love
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now,modern_love
Who shall take you afresh?,modern_love
Now who will burn you free,modern_love
"From your body's terrors and dross,",modern_love
Since the fire has failed in me?,modern_love
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern_love
The shrieking cross?,modern_love
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern_love
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern_love
"As I see it hardening,",modern_love
"Warping the perfect image of God,",modern_love
And darkening my eternal fame.,modern_love
Version 2 (1928),modern_love
"Yours is the sullen sorrow,",modern_love
The disgrace is also mine;,modern_love
"Your love was intense and thorough,",modern_love
Mine was the love of a growing flower,modern_love
For the sunshine.,modern_love
"You had the power to explore me,",modern_love
Blossom me stalk by stalk;,modern_love
"You woke my spirit, you bore me",modern_love
"To consciousness, you gave me the dour",modern_love
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.,modern_love
Body to body I could not,modern_love
"Love you, although I would.",modern_love
"We kissed, we kissed though we should not.",modern_love
"You yielded, we threw the last cast,",modern_love
And it was no good.,modern_love
"You only endured, and it broke",modern_love
My craftsman's nerve.,modern_love
No flesh responded to my stroke;,modern_love
So I failed to give you the last,modern_love
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern_love
"You are shapely, you are adorned",modern_love
But opaque and null in the flesh;,modern_love
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern_love
"Full anguish, perhaps had been cast",modern_love
In a lovely illuinined mesh,modern_love
Like a painted window; the best,modern_love
"Fire passed through your flesh,",modern_love
"Undrossed it, and left it blest",modern_love
In clean new awareness. But now,modern_love
Who shall take you afresh?,modern_love
Now who will burn you free,modern_love
From your body's deadness and dross?,modern_love
"Since the fire has failed in me,",modern_love
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern_love
The shrieking cross?,modern_love
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern_love
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern_love
As I see it hardening;,modern_love
I should have been cruel enough to bring,modern_love
"You through the flame.Strephon kissed me in the spring,",modern_love
"Robin in the fall,",modern_love
But Colin only looked at me,modern_love
And never kissed at all.,modern_love
"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,",modern_love
"Robin's lost in play,",modern_love
But the kiss in Colin's eyes,modern_love
"Haunts me night and day.Let us go then, you and I,",modern_love
When the evening is spread out against the sky,modern_love
Like a patient etherized upon a table;,modern_love
"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,",modern_love
The muttering retreats,modern_love
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels,modern_love
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:,modern_love
Streets that follow like a tedious argument,modern_love
Of insidious intent,modern_love
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...,modern_love
"Oh, do not ask, What is it?",modern_love
Let us go and make our visit.,modern_love
In the room the women come and go,modern_love
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern_love
"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,",modern_love
"The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,",modern_love
"Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,",modern_love
"Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,",modern_love
"Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,",modern_love
"Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,",modern_love
"And seeing that it was a soft October night,",modern_love
"Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.",modern_love
And indeed there will be time,modern_love
"For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,",modern_love
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;,modern_love
"There will be time, there will be time",modern_love
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;,modern_love
"There will be time to murder and create,",modern_love
And time for all the works and days of hands,modern_love
That lift and drop a question on your plate;,modern_love
"Time for you and time for me,",modern_love
"And time yet for a hundred indecisions,",modern_love
"And for a hundred visions and revisions,",modern_love
Before the taking of a toast and tea.,modern_love
In the room the women come and go,modern_love
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern_love
And indeed there will be time,modern_love
"To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?",modern_love
"Time to turn back and descend the stair,",modern_love
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair ,modern_love
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!),modern_love
"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,",modern_love
"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin ",modern_love
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!),modern_love
Do I dare,modern_love
Disturb the universe?,modern_love
In a minute there is time,modern_love
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.,modern_love
"For I have known them all already, known them all:",modern_love
"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,",modern_love
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;,modern_love
I know the voices dying with a dying fall,modern_love
Beneath the music from a farther room.,modern_love
So how should I presume?,modern_love
"And I have known the eyes already, known them all",modern_love
"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,",modern_love
"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,",modern_love
"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,",modern_love
Then how should I begin,modern_love
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?,modern_love
And how should I presume?,modern_love
"And I have known the arms already, known them all",modern_love
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,modern_love
"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)",modern_love
Is it perfume from a dress,modern_love
That makes me so digress?,modern_love
"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.",modern_love
And should I then presume?,modern_love
And how should I begin?,modern_love
"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets",modern_love
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes,modern_love
"Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...",modern_love
I should have been a pair of ragged claws,modern_love
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.,modern_love
"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!",modern_love
"Smoothed by long fingers,",modern_love
"Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,",modern_love
"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.",modern_love
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,",modern_love
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?,modern_love
"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,",modern_love
"Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,",modern_love
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;,modern_love
"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,",modern_love
"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,",modern_love
"And in short, I was afraid.",modern_love
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern_love
"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,",modern_love
"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,",modern_love
"Would it have been worth while,",modern_love
"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,",modern_love
To have squeezed the universe into a ball,modern_love
"To roll it towards some overwhelming question,",modern_love
"To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,",modern_love
"Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all",modern_love
"If one, settling a pillow by her head",modern_love
Should say: That is not what I meant at all;,modern_love
"That is not it, at all.",modern_love
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern_love
"Would it have been worth while,",modern_love
"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,",modern_love
"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor",modern_love
"And this, and so much more?",modern_love
It is impossible to say just what I mean!,modern_love
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:,modern_love
Would it have been worth while,modern_love
"If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,",modern_love
"And turning toward the window, should say:",modern_love
"That is not it at all,",modern_love
"That is not what I meant, at all.",modern_love
"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;",modern_love
"Am an attendant lord, one that will do",modern_love
"To swell a progress, start a scene or two,",modern_love
"Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,",modern_love
"Deferential, glad to be of use,",modern_love
"Politic, cautious, and meticulous;",modern_love
"Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;",modern_love
"At times, indeed, almost ridiculous",modern_love
"Almost, at times, the Fool.",modern_love
I grow old ... I grow old ...,modern_love
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.,modern_love
Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?,modern_love
"I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.",modern_love
"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.",modern_love
I do not think that they will sing to me.,modern_love
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves,modern_love
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back,modern_love
When the wind blows the water white and black.,modern_love
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea,modern_love
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown,modern_love
"Till human voices wake us, and we drown.I went to the dances at Chandlerville,",modern_love
And played snap-out at Winchester.,modern_love
"One time we changed partners,",modern_love
"Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,",modern_love
And then I found Davis.,modern_love
"We were married and lived together for seventy years,",modern_love
"Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,",modern_love
Eight of whom we lost,modern_love
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.,modern_love
"I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,",modern_love
"I made the garden, and for holiday",modern_love
"Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,",modern_love
"And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,",modern_love
And many a flower and medicinal weed ,modern_love
"Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.",modern_love
"At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,",modern_love
And passed to a sweet repose.,modern_love
"What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,",modern_love
"Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?",modern_love
"Degenerate sons and daughters,",modern_love
Life is too strong for you ,modern_love
"It takes life to love Life.Seen my lady home las' night,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love

"Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,",modern_love
An' a smile go flittin' by ,modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"An' my hea't was beatin' so,",modern_love
"When I reached my lady's do',",modern_love

"It gwine keep on saggin' low.I saw her in a Broadway car,",modern_love
The woman I might grow to be;,modern_love
I felt my lover look at her,modern_love
And then turn suddenly to me.,modern_love
Her hair was dull and drew no light,modern_love
And yet its color was as mine;,modern_love
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes,modern_love
Tho' love had never made them shine.,modern_love
"Her body was a thing grown thin,",modern_love
Hungry for love that never came;,modern_love
Her soul was frozen in the dark,modern_love
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.,modern_love
I felt my lover look at her,modern_love
"And then turn suddenly to me, ",modern_love
His eyes were magic to defy,modern_love
The woman I shall never be.,modern_love
Just as my fingers on these keys,modern_love
"Make music, so the selfsame sounds",modern_love
"On my spirit make a music, too.",modern_love
"Music is feeling, then, not sound;",modern_love
"And thus it is that what I feel,",modern_love
"Here in this room, desiring you,",modern_love
"Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,",modern_love
Is music. It is like the strain,modern_love
Waked in the elders by Susanna: ,modern_love
"Of a green evening, clear and warm,",modern_love
"She bathed in her still garden, while",modern_love
"The red-eyed elders, watching, felt",modern_love
The basses of their beings throb,modern_love
"In witching chords, and their thin blood",modern_love
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.,modern_love
"In the green water, clear and warm,",modern_love
Susanna lay.,modern_love
She searched,modern_love
"The touch of springs,",modern_love
And found,modern_love
Concealed imaginings.,modern_love
"She sighed,",modern_love
For so much melody.,modern_love
"Upon the bank, she stood",modern_love
In the cool,modern_love
Of spent emotions.,modern_love
"She felt, among the leaves,",modern_love
The dew,modern_love
Of old devotions.,modern_love
"She walked upon the grass,",modern_love
Still quavering.,modern_love
"The winds were like her maids,",modern_love
"On timid feet,",modern_love
"Fetching her woven scarves,",modern_love
Yet wavering.,modern_love
A breath upon her hand,modern_love
Muted the night.,modern_love
She turned,modern_love
"A cymbal crashed,",modern_love
And roaring horns.,modern_love
"Soon, with a noise like tambourines,",modern_love
Came her attendant Byzantines.,modern_love
They wondered why Susanna cried,modern_love
Against the elders by her side;,modern_love
"And as they whispered, the refrain",modern_love
Was like a willow swept by rain.,modern_love
"Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame",modern_love
Revealed Susanna and her shame.,modern_love
"And then, the simpering Byzantines",modern_love
"Fled, with a noise like tambourines.",modern_love
Beauty is momentary in the mind,modern_love
The fitful tracing of a portal;,modern_love
But in the flesh it is immortal.,modern_love
The body dies; the body's beauty lives.,modern_love
"So evenings die, in their green going,",modern_love
"A wave, interminably flowing.",modern_love
"So gardens die, their meek breath scenting",modern_love
"The cowl of winter, done repenting.",modern_love
"So maidens die, to the auroral",modern_love
Celebration of a maiden's choral.,modern_love
Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings,modern_love
"Of those white elders; but, escaping,",modern_love
Left only Death's ironic scraping.,modern_love
"Now, in its immortality, it plays",modern_love
"On the clear viol of her memory,",modern_love
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.I,modern_love
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon,modern_love
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do,modern_love
"With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";",modern_love
"And four wax candles in the darkened room,",modern_love
"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,",modern_love
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb,modern_love
"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.",modern_love
"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole",modern_love
"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.",modern_love
"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.",modern_love
And so the conversation slips,modern_love
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets,modern_love
Through attenuated tones of violins,modern_love
Mingled with remote cornets,modern_love
And begins.,modern_love
"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,",modern_love
"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find",modern_love
"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,",modern_love
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!,modern_love
How keen you are!),modern_love
"To find a friend who has these qualities,",modern_love
"Who has, and gives",modern_love
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.,modern_love
How much it means that I say this to you ,modern_love
"Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!",modern_love
Among the winding of the violins,modern_love
And the ariettes,modern_love
Of cracked cornets,modern_love
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins,modern_love
"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,",modern_love
Capricious monotone,modern_love
"That is at least one definite ""false note.""",modern_love
" Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,",modern_love
"Admire the monuments,",modern_love
"Discuss the late events,",modern_love
Correct our watches by the public clocks.,modern_love
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.,modern_love
Now that lilacs are in bloom,modern_love
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room,modern_love
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.,modern_love
"Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands;",modern_love
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks),modern_love
"You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.",modern_love
"I smile, of course,",modern_love
And go on drinking tea.,modern_love
"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall",modern_love
"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,",modern_love
"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world",modern_love
"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.",modern_love
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune,modern_love
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:,modern_love
I am always sure that you understand,modern_love
"My feelings, always sure that you feel,",modern_love
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.,modern_love
"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.",modern_love
"You will go on, and when you have prevailed",modern_love
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.,modern_love
"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,",modern_love
"To give you, what can you receive from me?",modern_love
Only the friendship and the sympathy,modern_love
Of one about to reach her journey's end.,modern_love
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....",modern_love
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends,modern_love
For what she has said to me?,modern_love
You will see me any morning in the park,modern_love
Reading the comics and the sporting page.,modern_love
Particularly I remark.,modern_love
An English countess goes upon the stage.,modern_love
"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,",modern_love
Another bank defaulter has confessed.,modern_love
"I keep my countenance,",modern_love
I remain self-possessed,modern_love
"Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired",modern_love
Reiterates some worn-out common song,modern_love
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden,modern_love
Recalling things that other people have desired.,modern_love
Are these ideas right or wrong?,modern_love
The October night comes down; returning as before,modern_love
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease,modern_love
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door,modern_love
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.,modern_love
And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?,modern_love
But that's a useless question.,modern_love
"You hardly know when you are coming back,",modern_love
You will find so much to learn.,modern_love
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.,modern_love
Perhaps you can write to me.,modern_love
My self-possession flares up for a second;,modern_love
This is as I had reckoned.,modern_love
"I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.",modern_love
"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark",modern_love
"Suddenly, his expression in a glass.",modern_love
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.,modern_love
"For everybody said so, all our friends,",modern_love
They all were sure our feelings would relate,modern_love
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.,modern_love
We must leave it now to fate.,modern_love
"You will write, at any rate.",modern_love
Perhaps it is not too late.,modern_love
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.",modern_love
And I must borrow every changing shape,modern_love
"To find expression ... dance, dance",modern_love
"Like a dancing bear,",modern_love
"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.",modern_love
"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance",modern_love
"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,",modern_love
"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;",modern_love
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand,modern_love
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;,modern_love
"Doubtful, for quite a while",modern_love
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand,modern_love
"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...",modern_love
"Would she not have the advantage, after all?",modern_love
"This music is successful with a ""dying fall""",modern_love
Now that we talk of dying,modern_love
"And should I have the right to smile?Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",modern_love
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",modern_love
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",modern_love
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",modern_love
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,modern_love
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",modern_love
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,modern_love
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",modern_love
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern_love
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",modern_love
"There is no marriage in heaven,",modern_love
But there is love.I shall not go with pain,modern_love
"Whether you hold me, whether you forget",modern_love
My little loss and my immortal gain.,modern_love
"O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look remembering yet,",modern_love
Sweet heart.,modern_love
"I shall not go with grief,",modern_love
"Whether you call me, whether you deny",modern_love
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.,modern_love
"O, April hopes that blossom but to close!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,",modern_love
Red rose.,modern_love
"I shall not go with sighs,",modern_love
"But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,",modern_love
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.,modern_love
"O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look and so good night,",modern_love

I knows yo' hea't's wid me.This youth too long has heard the break,modern_love
Of waters in a land of change.,modern_love
He goes to see what suns can make,modern_love
From soil more indurate and strange.,modern_love
He cuts what holds his days together,modern_love
"And shuts him in, as lock on lock:",modern_love
"The arrowed vane announcing weather,",modern_love
The tripping racket of a clock;,modern_love
"Seeking, I think, a light that waits",modern_love
"Still as a lamp upon a shelf, ",modern_love
A land with hills like rocky gates,modern_love
Where no sea leaps upon itself.,modern_love
But he will find that nothing dares,modern_love
"To be enduring, save where, south",modern_love
"Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares",modern_love
"On beauty with a rusted mouth, ",modern_love
Where something dreadful and another,modern_love
Look quietly upon each other.Making his advances,modern_love
"He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,",modern_love
"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.",modern_love
Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin,modern_love
That work beneath her while she sprawls along,modern_love
"In her ungainly pace,",modern_love
Her folds of skin that work and row,modern_love
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.,modern_love
And so he strains beneath her housey walls,modern_love
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak,modern_love
"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,",modern_love
And strange and grimly drags at her,modern_love
"Like a dog,",modern_love
"Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.",modern_love
"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.",modern_love
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation,modern_love
"And doomed to partiality, partial being,",modern_love
"Ache, and want of being,",modern_love
"Want,",modern_love
"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.",modern_love
"Born to walk alone,",modern_love
"Forerunner,",modern_love
"Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,",modern_love
"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,",modern_love
This grim necessity from within.,modern_love
Does she know,modern_love
As she moves eternally slowly away?,modern_love
"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,",modern_love
All knowledgeless?,modern_love
"The awful concussion,",modern_love
"And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,",modern_love
"Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,",modern_love
"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,",modern_love
"Driven away from himself into her tracks,",modern_love
Forced to crash against her.,modern_love
"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,",modern_love
"Little gentleman,",modern_love
"Sorry plight,",modern_love
We ought to look the other way.,modern_love
"Save that, having come with you so far,",modern_love
"We will go on to the end.I thought he was dumb,",modern_love
"I said he was dumb,",modern_love
Yet I've heard him cry.,modern_love
"First faint scream,",modern_love
"Out of life's unfathomable dawn,",modern_love
"Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,",modern_love
"Far, far off, far scream.",modern_love
Tortoise in extremis.,modern_love
Why were we crucified into sex?,modern_love
"Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,",modern_love
"As we began,",modern_love
"As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?",modern_love
"A far, was-it-audible scream,",modern_love
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?,modern_love
"Worse than the cry of the new-born,",modern_love
"A scream,",modern_love
"A yell,",modern_love
"A shout,",modern_love
"A pan,",modern_love
"A death-agony,",modern_love
"A birth-cry,",modern_love
"A submission,",modern_love
"All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.",modern_love
"War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,",modern_love
Why was the veil torn?,modern_love
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?,modern_love
The male soul's membrane,modern_love
"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.",modern_love
Crucifixion.,modern_love
"Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,",modern_love
"Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell",modern_love
"In tortoise-nakedness,",modern_love
"Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,",modern_love
"And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,",modern_love
"Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension",modern_love
"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!",modern_love
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck,modern_love
"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,",modern_love
"Super-audible,",modern_love
"From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,",modern_love
"Giving up the ghost,",modern_love
"Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.",modern_love
"His scream, and his moment's subsidence,",modern_love
"The moment of eternal silence,",modern_love
"Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once",modern_love
The inexpressible faint yell ,modern_love
"And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back",modern_love
"To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.",modern_love
"So he tups, and screams",modern_love
"Time after time that frail, torn scream",modern_love
"After each jerk, the longish interval,",modern_love
"The tortoise eternity,",modern_love
"Agelong, reptilian persistence,",modern_love
"Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.",modern_love
"I remember, when I was a boy,",modern_love
"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;",modern_love
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;,modern_love
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night,modern_love
"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;",modern_love
"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;",modern_love
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;,modern_love
"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;",modern_love
"I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;",modern_love
"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning",modern_love
"And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,",modern_love
"And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,",modern_love
"The first wail of an infant,",modern_love
"And my mother singing to herself,",modern_love
"And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,",modern_love
The first elements of foreign speech,modern_love
On wild dark lips.,modern_love
"And more than all these,",modern_love
"And less than all these,",modern_love
"This last,",modern_love
"Strange, faint coition yell",modern_love
"Of the male tortoise at extremity,",modern_love
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.,modern_love
"The cross,",modern_love
"The wheel on which our silence first is broken,",modern_love
"Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence",modern_love
Tearing a cry from us.,modern_love
"Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,",modern_love
"Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.",modern_love
"Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,",modern_love
"The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,",modern_love
"That which is whole, torn asunder,",modern_love
"That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe. With the man I love who loves me not,",modern_love
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;,modern_love
We watched the world go home that night,modern_love
In a flood through Union Square.,modern_love
I leaned to catch the words he said,modern_love
That were light as a snowflake falling;,modern_love
Ah well that he never leaned to hear,modern_love
The words my heart was calling.,modern_love
And on we walked and on we walked,modern_love
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows ,modern_love
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by,modern_love
On the errand each man knows.,modern_love
"And on we walked and on we walked,",modern_love
At the door at last we said good-bye;,modern_love
I knew by his smile he had not heard,modern_love
My heart's unuttered cry.,modern_love
With the man I love who loves me not,modern_love
I walked in the street-lamps' flare ,modern_love
"But oh, the girls who ask for love",modern_love
In the lights of Union Square.,modern_love
"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,",modern_love
"And nodding by the fire, take down this book,",modern_love
"And slowly read, and dream of the soft look",modern_love
"Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;",modern_love
"How many loved your moments of glad grace,",modern_love
"And loved your beauty with love false or true,",modern_love
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,",modern_love
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;,modern_love
"And bending down beside the glowing bars,",modern_love
"Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled",modern_love
And paced upon the mountains overhead,modern_love
"And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.Give me hunger,",modern_love
O you gods that sit and give,modern_love
The world its orders.,modern_love
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern_love
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern_love
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern_love
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern_love
"But leave me a little love,",modern_love
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern_love
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern_love
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern_love
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern_love
"Blurring the sunset,",modern_love
"One little wandering, western star",modern_love
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern_love
"Let me go to the window,",modern_love
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern_love
And wait and know the coming,modern_love
"Of a little love.Potuia, potuia",modern_love
"White grave goddess,",modern_love
"Pity my sadness,",modern_love
O silence of Paros.,modern_love
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern_love
These garments and decorum;,modern_love
"I am thy brother,",modern_love
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern_love
And thou hearest me not.,modern_love
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern_love
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern_love
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern_love
When the fragile pipes,modern_love
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern_love
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern_love
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern_love
And only the cicada sang.,modern_love
I have told thee of the hills,modern_love
And the lisp of reeds,modern_love
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern_love
"And thou hearest me not,",modern_love
"Potuia, potuia",modern_love
Thou hearest me not.,modern_love
"I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,",modern_mythology_folklore
Weak from the noon-day heat.,modern_mythology_folklore
"A church bell sounded mournfully far away,",modern_mythology_folklore
"I heard the cry of a baby,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the coughing of John Yarnell,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,",modern_mythology_folklore
Then the violent voice of my wife:,modern_mythology_folklore
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!",modern_mythology_folklore
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.,modern_mythology_folklore
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...,modern_mythology_folklore
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Too late! Thus I came here,",modern_mythology_folklore
"With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,",modern_mythology_folklore
Though one must breathe,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,",modern_mythology_folklore
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.,modern_mythology_folklore
When I felt the bullet enter my heart,modern_mythology_folklore
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,",modern_mythology_folklore
Instead of running away and joining the army.,modern_mythology_folklore
Rather a thousand times the county jail,modern_mythology_folklore
"Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.",modern_mythology_folklore
"What do they mean, anyway?I was only eight years old;",modern_mythology_folklore
And before I grew up and knew what it meant,modern_mythology_folklore
"I had no words for it, except",modern_mythology_folklore
That I was frightened and told my,modern_mythology_folklore
Mother; And that my Father got a pistol,modern_mythology_folklore
"And would have killed Charlie, who was a big boy,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Fifteen years old, except for his Mother.",modern_mythology_folklore
Nevertheless the story clung to me.,modern_mythology_folklore
"But the man who married me, a widower of thirty-five,",modern_mythology_folklore
Was a newcomer and never heard it,modern_mythology_folklore
Till two years after we were married.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Then he considered himself cheated,",modern_mythology_folklore
And the village agreed that I was not really a virgin.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, he deserted me, and I died",modern_mythology_folklore
The following winter.,modern_mythology_folklore
Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_mythology_folklore
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_mythology_folklore
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_mythology_folklore
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_mythology_folklore
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_mythology_folklore
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_mythology_folklore
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_mythology_folklore
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_mythology_folklore
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_mythology_folklore
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_mythology_folklore
Was there another Troy for her to burn?I ,modern_mythology_folklore
GLOOM! ,modern_mythology_folklore
An October like November; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"August a hundred thousand hours, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And all September, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And half October like a thousand years . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
That then was Antwerp. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"In the name of God, ",modern_mythology_folklore
How could they do it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Those souls that usually dived ,modern_mythology_folklore
Into the dirty caverns of mines; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Who usually hived ,modern_mythology_folklore
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Those men there, with the appearance of clods ",modern_mythology_folklore
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God ,modern_mythology_folklore
Ever shrived. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. ,modern_mythology_folklore
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them ,modern_mythology_folklore
"To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. ,modern_mythology_folklore
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours ,modern_mythology_folklore
"For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays ",modern_mythology_folklore
"In the name of God, how could they do it? ",modern_mythology_folklore
"For there is no new thing under the sun, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the gloom. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
What the devil will he gain by it? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it ,modern_mythology_folklore
Waiting his doom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Till the trench of gray mud ,modern_mythology_folklore
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Well, there have been scars ",modern_mythology_folklore
Won in many wars . . .,modern_mythology_folklore
"Punic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Overspreading his miserable land, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
Doom! ,modern_mythology_folklore
"He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . ",modern_mythology_folklore
An image that shall take long to pass! ,modern_mythology_folklore
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses ,modern_mythology_folklore
Forever through our brains. ,modern_mythology_folklore
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; ,modern_mythology_folklore
And battalions and battalions and battalions ,modern_mythology_folklore
"The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pass, for ever staunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Stand, for ever true; ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the small man with the large paunch, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Watches them pass ,modern_mythology_folklore
In our minds for ever . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
But that clutter of sodden corses ,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sodden Belgian grass ,modern_mythology_folklore
That is a strange new beauty. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Assuredly that is the way of it, ",modern_mythology_folklore
The way of beauty . . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. ,modern_mythology_folklore
For you cannot praise it with words ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Compounded of lyres and swords, ",modern_mythology_folklore
But the thought of the gloom and the rain ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Shall eat itself into your brain: ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! ",modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And that shall be an honourable name; ,modern_mythology_folklore
Belgian shall be an honourable word; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the fame of the sword, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they bear it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't know. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And what in the world did they dare it for? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go ,modern_mythology_folklore
Over their fields and between their cities ,modern_mythology_folklore
Down into more southerly regions. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. ,modern_mythology_folklore
I don't understand. ,modern_mythology_folklore
Was it just love of their land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Oh, poor dears! ",modern_mythology_folklore
Can any man so love his land? ,modern_mythology_folklore
Give them a thousand thousand pities ,modern_mythology_folklore
And rivers and rivers of tears ,modern_mythology_folklore
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is midnight; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is a great crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
And no light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. ",modern_mythology_folklore
"Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! ",modern_mythology_folklore
She has a dead face; ,modern_mythology_folklore
She is dressed all in black; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"She wanders to the bookstall and back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
At the back of the crowd; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And back again and again back, ",modern_mythology_folklore
She sways and wanders. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; ,modern_mythology_folklore
It is one o'clock. ,modern_mythology_folklore
"There is still a great cloud, and very little light; ",modern_mythology_folklore
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd ,modern_mythology_folklore
That hardly whispers aloud. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And now! .  . That is another dead mother, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And there is another and another and another. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore
"And little children, all in black, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, ",modern_mythology_folklore
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room ,modern_mythology_folklore
In the dim gloom. ,modern_mythology_folklore
These are the women of Flanders.,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost. ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train ,modern_mythology_folklore
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, ",modern_mythology_folklore
In the dark of the night. ,modern_mythology_folklore
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is very little light. ,modern_mythology_folklore
There is so much pain. ,modern_mythology_folklore
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; ,modern_mythology_folklore
"This October like November, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"That August like a hundred thousand hours, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"And that September, ",modern_mythology_folklore
"A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And half October like a thousand years. . . ,modern_mythology_folklore

The stenographic smiles and stock quotations,modern_mythology_folklore
Smutty wings flash out equivocations.,modern_mythology_folklore
The mind is brushed by sparrow wings;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Numbers, rebuffed by asphalt, crowd",modern_mythology_folklore
"The margins of the day, accent the curbs,",modern_mythology_folklore
Convoying divers dawns on every corner,modern_mythology_folklore
"To druggist, barber and tobacconist,",modern_mythology_folklore
Until the graduate opacities of evening,modern_mythology_folklore
Take them away as suddenly to somewhere,modern_mythology_folklore
"Virginal perhaps, less fragmentary, cool.",modern_mythology_folklore
There is the world dimensional for,modern_mythology_folklore
those untwisted by the love of things,modern_mythology_folklore
"And yet, suppose some evening I forgot",modern_mythology_folklore
"The fare and transfer, yet got by that way",modern_mythology_folklore
"Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,",modern_mythology_folklore
Still flickering with those prefigurations,modern_mythology_folklore
"Prodigal, yet uncontested now,",modern_mythology_folklore
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.,modern_mythology_folklore
"There is some way, I think, to touch",modern_mythology_folklore
Those hands of yours that count the nights,modern_mythology_folklore
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.,modern_mythology_folklore
"And now, before its arteries turn dark",modern_mythology_folklore
I would have you meet this bartered blood.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Imminent in his dream, none better knows",modern_mythology_folklore
"The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words",modern_mythology_folklore
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.,modern_mythology_folklore
Reflective conversion of all things,modern_mythology_folklore
"At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread",modern_mythology_folklore
"The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread",modern_mythology_folklore
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   ,modern_mythology_folklore
"Inevitable, the body of the world",modern_mythology_folklore
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus,modern_mythology_folklore
"That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.",modern_mythology_folklore
The earth may glide diaphanous to death;,modern_mythology_folklore
But if I lift my arms it is to bend,modern_mythology_folklore
"To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing",modern_mythology_folklore
"The press of troubled hands, too alternate",modern_mythology_folklore
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.,modern_mythology_folklore
"I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame",modern_mythology_folklore
"You found in final chains, no captive then",modern_mythology_folklore
"Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;",modern_mythology_folklore
"White, through white cities passed on to assume",modern_mythology_folklore
That world which comes to each of us alone.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,",modern_mythology_folklore
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways,modern_mythology_folklore

Blest excursion! this ricochet,modern_mythology_folklore
From roof to roof,modern_mythology_folklore
"Know, Olympians, we are breathless",modern_mythology_folklore
While nigger cupids scour the stars!,modern_mythology_folklore
A thousand light shrugs balance us,modern_mythology_folklore
Through snarling hails of melody.,modern_mythology_folklore
White shadows slip across the floor,modern_mythology_folklore
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;,modern_mythology_folklore
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters,modern_mythology_folklore
Until somewhere a rooster banters.,modern_mythology_folklore
Greet naivelyyet intrepidly,modern_mythology_folklore
"New soothings, new amazements",modern_mythology_folklore
That cornets introduce at every turn,modern_mythology_folklore
And you may fall downstairs with me,modern_mythology_folklore
With perfect grace and equanimity.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or, plaintively scud past shores",modern_mythology_folklore
"Where, by strange harmonic laws",modern_mythology_folklore
"All relatives, serene and cool,",modern_mythology_folklore
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.,modern_mythology_folklore
"O,I have known metallic paradises",modern_mythology_folklore
Where cuckoos clucked to finches,modern_mythology_folklore
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.,modern_mythology_folklore
While titters hailed the groans of death,modern_mythology_folklore
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen,modern_mythology_folklore
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.,modern_mythology_folklore
This music has a reassuring way.,modern_mythology_folklore
The siren of the springs of guilty song,modern_mythology_folklore
Let us take her on the incandescent wax,modern_mythology_folklore
"Striated with nuances, nervosities",modern_mythology_folklore
"That we are heir to: she is still so young,",modern_mythology_folklore
"We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,",modern_mythology_folklore
Dipping here in this cultivated storm,modern_mythology_folklore
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.,modern_mythology_folklore
Capped arbiter of beauty in this street,modern_mythology_folklore
"That narrows darkly into motor dawn,",modern_mythology_folklore
"You, here beside me, delicate ambassador",modern_mythology_folklore
Of intricate slain numbers that arise,modern_mythology_folklore
"In whispers, naked of steel;",modern_mythology_folklore
religious gunman!,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who faithfully, yourself, will fall too soon,",modern_mythology_folklore
And in other ways than as the wind settles,modern_mythology_folklore
On the sixteen thrifty bridges of the city:,modern_mythology_folklore
Let us unbind our throats of fear and pity.,modern_mythology_folklore
"We even,",modern_mythology_folklore
Who drove speediest destruction,modern_mythology_folklore
"In corymbulous formations of mechanics,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice",modern_mythology_folklore
"Plangent over meadows, and looked down",modern_mythology_folklore
On rifts of torn and empty houses,modern_mythology_folklore
Like old women with teeth unjubilant,modern_mythology_folklore
"That waited faintly, briefly and in vain:",modern_mythology_folklore
"We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers",modern_mythology_folklore
"The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The mounted, yielding cities of the air!",modern_mythology_folklore
That saddled sky that shook down vertical,modern_mythology_folklore
Repeated play of fireno hypogeum,modern_mythology_folklore
Of wave or rock was good against one hour.,modern_mythology_folklore
"We did not ask for that, but have survived,",modern_mythology_folklore
And will persist to speak again before,modern_mythology_folklore
All stubble streets that have not curved,modern_mythology_folklore
"To memory, or known the ominous lifted arm",modern_mythology_folklore
That lowers down the arc of Helens brow,modern_mythology_folklore
To saturate with blessing and dismay.,modern_mythology_folklore
"A goose, tobacco and cologne",modern_mythology_folklore
"Three winged and gold-shod prophecies of heaven,",modern_mythology_folklore
The lavish heart shall always have to leaven,modern_mythology_folklore
"And spread with bells and voices, and atone",modern_mythology_folklore
The abating shadows of our conscript dust.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Anchises navel, dripping of the sea,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The hands Erasmus dipped in gleaming tides,",modern_mythology_folklore
Gathered the voltage of blown blood and vine;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Delve upward for the new and scattered wine,",modern_mythology_folklore
"O brother-thief of time, that we recall.",modern_mythology_folklore
Laugh out the meager penance of their days,modern_mythology_folklore
"Who dare not share with us the breath released,",modern_mythology_folklore
The substance drilled and spent beyond repair,modern_mythology_folklore
"For golden, or the shadow of gold hair.",modern_mythology_folklore

Blamed bleeding hands extend and thresh the height,modern_mythology_folklore
"The imagination spans beyond despair,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Outpacing bargain, vocable and prayer.",modern_mythology_folklore
We passed old farmer Boothby in the field.,modern_mythology_folklore
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern_mythology_folklore
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern_mythology_folklore
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern_mythology_folklore
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern_mythology_folklore
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern_mythology_folklore
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern_mythology_folklore
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern_mythology_folklore
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern_mythology_folklore
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern_mythology_folklore
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern_mythology_folklore
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern_mythology_folklore
View of the river. And we strode,modern_mythology_folklore
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern_mythology_folklore
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern_mythology_folklore
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern_mythology_folklore
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern_mythology_folklore
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern_mythology_folklore
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern_mythology_folklore
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern_mythology_folklore
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern_mythology_folklore
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern_mythology_folklore
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern_mythology_folklore
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern_mythology_folklore
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern_mythology_folklore
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern_mythology_folklore
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern_mythology_folklore
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern_mythology_folklore
Motionless in the meadows,modern_mythology_folklore
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern_mythology_folklore
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern_mythology_folklore
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern_mythology_folklore
The tree-toads started ringing,modern_mythology_folklore
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern_mythology_folklore
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern_mythology_folklore
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern_mythology_folklore
The rivers tiny canon,modern_mythology_folklore
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern_mythology_folklore
Like a dark and silent companion,modern_mythology_folklore
Evening held out her hands.,modern_mythology_folklore
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern_mythology_folklore
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern_mythology_folklore
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern_mythology_folklore
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern_mythology_folklore
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern_mythology_folklore
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern_mythology_folklore
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern_mythology_folklore
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern_mythology_folklore
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern_mythology_folklore
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern_mythology_folklore
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern_mythology_folklore
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern_mythology_folklore
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern_mythology_folklore
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern_mythology_folklore
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern_mythology_folklore
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern_mythology_folklore
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern_mythology_folklore
The woods became his background; every tree,modern_mythology_folklore
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern_mythology_folklore
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern_mythology_folklore
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern_mythology_folklore
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern_mythology_folklore
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern_mythology_folklore
With such a native element;,modern_mythology_folklore
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern_mythology_folklore
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern_mythology_folklore
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern_mythology_folklore
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern_mythology_folklore
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern_mythology_folklore
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no might",modern_mythology_folklore
"To make you hear,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Now, in the inmost night,",modern_mythology_folklore
I am so near,modern_mythology_folklore
"No whisper, falling light,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Divides us, dear.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no claim",modern_mythology_folklore
On your great hours.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Now the thin candle-flame,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The closing flowers,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Wed summer with my name, ",modern_mythology_folklore
And these are ours.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Your shadow on the dust,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Strength, and a cry,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Delight, despair, mistrust, ",modern_mythology_folklore
All these am I.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Dawn, and the far hills thrust",modern_mythology_folklore
To a far sky.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Living, I had no skill",modern_mythology_folklore
"To stay your tread,",modern_mythology_folklore
Now all that was my will,modern_mythology_folklore
Silence has said.,modern_mythology_folklore
We are one for good and ill,modern_mythology_folklore
"Since I am dead.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern_mythology_folklore
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern_mythology_folklore
"Yes, Momus,",modern_mythology_folklore
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern_mythology_folklore
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern_mythology_folklore
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern_mythology_folklore
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern_mythology_folklore
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern_mythology_folklore
"I wonder, Momus,",modern_mythology_folklore
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,modern_mythology_folklore
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",modern_mythology_folklore
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",modern_mythology_folklore
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",modern_mythology_folklore
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",modern_mythology_folklore
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,modern_mythology_folklore
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And blood drops of undiminishing war.Potuia, potuia",modern_mythology_folklore
"White grave goddess,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Pity my sadness,",modern_mythology_folklore
O silence of Paros.,modern_mythology_folklore
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern_mythology_folklore
These garments and decorum;,modern_mythology_folklore
"I am thy brother,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern_mythology_folklore
And thou hearest me not.,modern_mythology_folklore
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern_mythology_folklore
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern_mythology_folklore
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern_mythology_folklore
When the fragile pipes,modern_mythology_folklore
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern_mythology_folklore
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern_mythology_folklore
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern_mythology_folklore
And only the cicada sang.,modern_mythology_folklore
I have told thee of the hills,modern_mythology_folklore
And the lisp of reeds,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And thou hearest me not,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Potuia, potuia",modern_mythology_folklore
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,modern_mythology_folklore
Pass deathward mournfully.,modern_mythology_folklore
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",modern_mythology_folklore
Symbols of ancient songs,modern_mythology_folklore
Mournfully passing,modern_mythology_folklore
"Down to the great white surges,",modern_mythology_folklore
Watched of none         - -,modern_mythology_folklore
Save the frail sea-birds,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the lithe pale girls,",modern_mythology_folklore
Daughters of Okeanos.,modern_mythology_folklore
And the songs pass,modern_mythology_folklore
From the green land,modern_mythology_folklore
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,modern_mythology_folklore
On the flowers of hyacinth;,modern_mythology_folklore
"And they pass from the waters,",modern_mythology_folklore
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And they come,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",modern_mythology_folklore
To the quiet level lands,modern_mythology_folklore
"That she keeps for us all,",modern_mythology_folklore
That she wrought for us all for sleep,modern_mythology_folklore
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,modern_mythology_folklore
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",modern_mythology_folklore
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And we turn from thee,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Phoibos Apollon,",modern_mythology_folklore
And we turn from the music of old,modern_mythology_folklore
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And we turn from the fiery day,",modern_mythology_folklore
And the lips that were over-sweet;,modern_mythology_folklore
For silently,modern_mythology_folklore
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",modern_mythology_folklore
With purple robe,modern_mythology_folklore
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Death,",modern_mythology_folklore
Thou hast come upon us.,modern_mythology_folklore
And of all the ancient songs,modern_mythology_folklore
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,modern_mythology_folklore
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",modern_mythology_folklore
This only remains:,modern_mythology_folklore
"That in the end we turn to thee,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Death,",modern_mythology_folklore
"That we turn to thee, singing",modern_mythology_folklore
One last song.,modern_mythology_folklore
"O Death,",modern_mythology_folklore
Thou art an healing wind,modern_mythology_folklore
That blowest over white flowers,modern_mythology_folklore
A-tremble with dew;,modern_mythology_folklore
Thou art a wind flowing,modern_mythology_folklore
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,modern_mythology_folklore
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,modern_mythology_folklore
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,modern_mythology_folklore
Thou art the pale peace of one,modern_mythology_folklore
Satiate with old desires;,modern_mythology_folklore
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",modern_mythology_folklore
And we look no more for the morning;,modern_mythology_folklore
"We yearn no more for the sun,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Since with thy white hands,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Death,",modern_mythology_folklore
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",modern_mythology_folklore
The slim colorless poppies,modern_mythology_folklore
Which in thy garden alone,modern_mythology_folklore
Softly thou gatherest.,modern_mythology_folklore
And silently;,modern_mythology_folklore
And with slow feet approaching;,modern_mythology_folklore
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",modern_mythology_folklore
We kneel before thee:,modern_mythology_folklore
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",modern_mythology_folklore
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",modern_mythology_folklore
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",modern_mythology_folklore
Thou sealest our eyes,modern_mythology_folklore

Comes gently upon us.,modern_mythology_folklore
Knock knock He has closed his door,modern_nature
The gardens lilies have started to rot,modern_nature
So who is the corpse being carried from the house,modern_nature
You just knocked on his door,modern_nature
And trot trot,modern_nature
Trot goes little lady mouse,modern_nature
Translated from the French I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean,modern_nature
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes,modern_nature
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are,modern_nature
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes,modern_nature
House of dampness,modern_nature
House of burning,modern_nature
Seasons fastness,modern_nature
Season singing,modern_nature
The airplanes are laying eggs,modern_nature
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor,modern_nature
Watch out for the shooting black ichor,modern_nature
It would be good if you were to come from the sky,modern_nature
The skys honeysuckle is climbing,modern_nature
The earthly octopi are throbbing,modern_nature
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers,modern_nature
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks,modern_nature
Around the house is this ocean that you know well,modern_nature
  And is never still,modern_nature
"Translated from the French Wallace Stevens,",modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still;",modern_nature
Go to the guards of the heavenly fold,modern_nature
"And bid them wander obeying your will,",modern_nature
"Flame under flame, till Time be no more;",modern_nature
"Have you not heard that our hearts are old,",modern_nature
"That you call in birds, in wind on the hill,",modern_nature
"In shaken boughs, in tide on the shore?",modern_nature
"O sweet everlasting Voices, be still. Although you hide in the ebb and flow",modern_nature
"Of the pale tide when the moon has set,",modern_nature
The people of coming days will know,modern_nature
"About the casting out of my net,",modern_nature
And how you have leaped times out of mind,modern_nature
"Over the little silver cords,",modern_nature
"And think that you were hard and unkind,",modern_nature
"And blame you with many bitter words.She that but little patience knew,",modern_nature
"From childhood on, had now so much",modern_nature
A grey gull lost its fear and flew,modern_nature
"Down to her cell and there alit,",modern_nature
And there endured her fingers' touch,modern_nature
And from her fingers ate its bit.,modern_nature
Did she in touching that lone wing,modern_nature
Recall the years before her mind,modern_nature
"Became a bitter, an abstract thing,",modern_nature
Her thought some popular enmity:,modern_nature
Blind and leader of the blind,modern_nature
Drinking the foul ditch where they lie?,modern_nature
When long ago I saw her ride,modern_nature
"Under Ben Bulben to the meet,",modern_nature
The beauty of her country-side,modern_nature
"With all youth's lonely wildness stirred,",modern_nature
She seemed to have grown clean and sweet,modern_nature
"Like any rock-bred, sea-borne bird:",modern_nature
"Sea-borne, or balanced in the air",modern_nature
When first it sprang out of the nest,modern_nature
Upon some lofty rock to stare,modern_nature
"Upon the cloudy canopy,",modern_nature
While under its storm-beaten breast,modern_nature
"Cried out the hollows of the sea.There was a man whom Sorrow named his friend,",modern_nature
"And he, of his high comrade Sorrow dreaming,",modern_nature
Went walking with slow steps along the gleaming,modern_nature
"And humming sands, where windy surges wend:",modern_nature
And he called loudly to the stars to bend,modern_nature
"From their pale thrones and comfort him, but they",modern_nature
Among themselves laugh on and sing alway:,modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Cried out, Dim sea, hear my most piteous story!",modern_nature
"The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,",modern_nature
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.,modern_nature
He fled the persecution of her glory,modern_nature
"And, in a far-off, gentle valley stopping,",modern_nature
Cried all his story to the dewdrops glistening.,modern_nature
"But naught they heard, for they are always listening,",modern_nature
"The dewdrops, for the sound of their own dropping.",modern_nature
And then the man whom Sorrow named his friend,modern_nature
"Sought once again the shore, and found a shell,",modern_nature
"And thought, I will my heavy story tell",modern_nature
"Till my own words, re-echoing, shall send",modern_nature
"Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;",modern_nature
"And my own tale again for me shall sing,",modern_nature
"And my own whispering words be comforting,",modern_nature
And lo! my ancient burden may depart.,modern_nature
Then he sang softly nigh the pearly rim;,modern_nature
But the sad dweller by the sea-ways lone,modern_nature
Changed all he sang to inarticulate moan,modern_nature
"Among her wildering whirls, forgetting him. The woods of Arcady are dead,",modern_nature
And over is their antique joy;,modern_nature
Of old the world on dreaming fed;,modern_nature
Grey Truth is now her painted toy;,modern_nature
Yet still she turns her restless head:,modern_nature
"But O, sick children of the world,",modern_nature
Of all the many changing things,modern_nature
"In dreary dancing past us whirled,",modern_nature
"To the cracked tune that Chronos sings,",modern_nature
Words alone are certain good.,modern_nature
"Where are now the warring kings,",modern_nature
Word be-mockers?  By the Rood,modern_nature
Where are now the warring kings?,modern_nature
"An idle word is now their glory,",modern_nature
"By the stammering schoolboy said,",modern_nature
Reading some entangled story:,modern_nature
The kings of the old time are dead;,modern_nature
The wandering earth herself may be,modern_nature
"Only a sudden flaming word,",modern_nature
"In clanging space a moment heard,",modern_nature
Troubling the endless reverie.,modern_nature
"Then nowise worship dusty deeds,",modern_nature
"Nor seek, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
"To hunger fiercely after truth,",modern_nature
Lest all thy toiling only breeds,modern_nature
"New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth",modern_nature
"Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then,",modern_nature
"No learning from the starry men,",modern_nature
Who follow with the optic glass,modern_nature
The whirling ways of stars that pass  ,modern_nature
"Seek, then, for this is also sooth,",modern_nature
No word of theirs  the cold star-bane,modern_nature
"Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain,",modern_nature
And dead is all their human truth.,modern_nature
Go gather by the humming sea,modern_nature
"Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,",modern_nature
"And to its lips thy story tell,",modern_nature

"Since there is no escape, since at the end",modern_nature
"My body will be utterly destroyed,",modern_nature
"This hand I love as I have loved a friend,",modern_nature
"This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;",modern_nature
Since there is no escape even for me,modern_nature
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:,modern_nature
"The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea",modern_nature
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,modern_nature
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",modern_nature
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,modern_nature
"In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;",modern_nature
In these few hours of light I lift my head;,modern_nature
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,modern_nature
If there is any way to baffle death.,modern_nature
"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!",modern_nature
When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;   ,modern_nature
"When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,   ",modern_nature
And the river flows like a stream of glass;,modern_nature
"When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,   ",modern_nature
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals,modern_nature
I know what the caged bird feels!,modern_nature
I know why the caged bird beats his wing,modern_nature
Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;   ,modern_nature
For he must fly back to his perch and cling   ,modern_nature
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;,modern_nature
"And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars   ",modern_nature
And they pulse again with a keener sting,modern_nature
I know why he beats his wing!,modern_nature
"I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,",modern_nature
"When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,",modern_nature
When he beats his bars and he would be free;,modern_nature
"It is not a carol of joy or glee,",modern_nature
"But a prayer that he sends from his hearts deep core,   ",modern_nature
"But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings",modern_nature
I know why the caged bird sings!,modern_nature
"There may be chaos still around the world,",modern_nature
This little world that in my thinking lies;,modern_nature
For mine own bosom is the paradise,modern_nature
Where all my lifes fair visions are unfurled.,modern_nature
"Within my natures shell I slumber curled,",modern_nature
"Unmindful of the changing outer skies,",modern_nature
"Where now, perchance, some new-born Eros flies,",modern_nature
Or some old Cronos from his throne is hurled.,modern_nature
I heed them not; or if the subtle night,modern_nature
"Haunt me with deities I never saw,",modern_nature
I soon mine eyelids drowsy curtain draw,modern_nature
To hide their myriad faces from my sight.,modern_nature
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe,modern_nature
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw.I,modern_nature
"Among twenty snowy mountains,",modern_nature
The only moving thing,modern_nature
Was the eye of the blackbird.,modern_nature
"I was of three minds,",modern_nature
Like a tree,modern_nature
In which there are three blackbirds.,modern_nature
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.,modern_nature
It was a small part of the pantomime.,modern_nature
A man and a woman,modern_nature
Are one.,modern_nature
A man and a woman and a blackbird   ,modern_nature
Are one.,modern_nature
"I do not know which to prefer,",modern_nature
The beauty of inflections,modern_nature
"Or the beauty of innuendoes,",modern_nature
The blackbird whistling,modern_nature
Or just after.,modern_nature
Icicles filled the long window,modern_nature
With barbaric glass.,modern_nature
The shadow of the blackbird,modern_nature
"Crossed it, to and fro.",modern_nature
The mood,modern_nature
Traced in the shadow,modern_nature
An indecipherable cause.,modern_nature
"O thin men of Haddam,",modern_nature
Why do you imagine golden birds?,modern_nature
Do you not see how the blackbird,modern_nature
Walks around the feet,modern_nature
Of the women about you?,modern_nature
I know noble accents,modern_nature
"And lucid, inescapable rhythms;",modern_nature
"But I know, too,",modern_nature
That the blackbird is involved,modern_nature
In what I know.,modern_nature
"When the blackbird flew out of sight,",modern_nature
It marked the edge,modern_nature
Of one of many circles.,modern_nature
At the sight of blackbirds,modern_nature
"Flying in a green light,",modern_nature
Even the bawds of euphony,modern_nature
Would cry out sharply.,modern_nature
He rode over Connecticut,modern_nature
In a glass coach.,modern_nature
"Once, a fear pierced him,",modern_nature
In that he mistook,modern_nature
The shadow of his equipage,modern_nature
For blackbirds.,modern_nature
The river is moving.,modern_nature
The blackbird must be flying.,modern_nature
It was evening all afternoon.,modern_nature
It was snowing,modern_nature
And it was going to snow.,modern_nature
The blackbird sat,modern_nature
In the cedar-limbs.I,modern_nature
"Calm was the sea to which your course you kept,",modern_nature
"Oh, how much calmer than all southern seas!",modern_nature
"Many your nameless mates, whom the keen breeze",modern_nature
Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.,modern_nature
All souls of children taken as they slept,modern_nature
"Are your companions, partners of your ease,",modern_nature
And the green souls of all these autumn trees,modern_nature
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.,modern_nature
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath,modern_nature
"Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,",modern_nature
But that we merit not your holy death?,modern_nature
"We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;",modern_nature
"Living you made it goodlier to live,",modern_nature
Dead you will make it easier to die.,modern_nature
With you a part of me hath passed away;,modern_nature
For in the peopled forest of my mind,modern_nature
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind,modern_nature
Shall never don again its green array.,modern_nature
"Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,",modern_nature
Have something of their friendliness resigned;,modern_nature
"Another, if I would, I could not find,",modern_nature
And I am grown much older in a day.,modern_nature
But yet I treasure in my memory,modern_nature
"Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,",modern_nature
And the dear honour of your amity;,modern_nature
"For these once mine, my life is rich with these.",modern_nature
"And I scarce know which part may greater be,",modern_nature
"What I keep of you, or you rob of me.",modern_nature
Your bark lies anchored in the peaceful bight,modern_nature
Until a kinder wind unfurl her sail;,modern_nature
"Your docile spirit, winged by this gale,",modern_nature
Hath at the dawning fled into the light.,modern_nature
And I half know why heaven deemed it right,modern_nature
"Your youth, and this my joy in youth, should fail;",modern_nature
"God hath them still, for ever they avail,",modern_nature
Eternity hath borrowed that delight.,modern_nature
For long ago I taught my thoughts to run,modern_nature
"Where all the great things live that lived of yore,",modern_nature
And in eternal quiet float and soar;,modern_nature
"There all my loves are gathered into one,",modern_nature
"Where change is not, nor parting any more,",modern_nature
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.,modern_nature
In my deep heart these chimes would still have rung,modern_nature
"To toll your passing, had you not been dead;",modern_nature
For time a sadder mask than death may spread,modern_nature
Over the face that ever should be young.,modern_nature
The bough that falls with all its trophies hung,modern_nature
"Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head",modern_nature
"Most royal in the dust, with no leaf shed",modern_nature
Unhallowed or unchiselled or unsung.,modern_nature
And though the after world will never hear,modern_nature
"The happy name of one so gently true,",modern_nature
"Nor chronicles write large this fatal year,",modern_nature
"Yet we who loved you, though we be but few,",modern_nature
"Keep you in whatsoeer is good, and rear",modern_nature
In our weak virtues monuments to you.,modern_nature
But then there comes that moment rare,modern_nature
"When, for no cause that I can find,",modern_nature
The little voices of the air,modern_nature
Sound above all the sea and wind.,modern_nature
The sea and wind do then obey,modern_nature
"And sighing, sighing double notes",modern_nature
"Of double basses, content to play",modern_nature
A droning chord for the little throats,modern_nature
The little throats that sing and rise,modern_nature
Up into the light with lovely ease,modern_nature
"And a kind of magical, sweet surprise",modern_nature
To hear and know themselves for these,modern_nature
"For these little voices: the bee, the fly,",modern_nature
"The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,",modern_nature
"The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,",modern_nature
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes,modern_nature
"Even iron can put forth,",modern_nature
Even iron.,modern_nature
"This is the iron age,",modern_nature
But let us take heart,modern_nature
"Seeing iron break and bud,",modern_nature
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.,modern_nature
"The almond-tree,",modern_nature
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.,modern_nature
"The almond-tree,",modern_nature
"That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake",modern_nature
In supreme bitterness.,modern_nature
"Upon the iron, and upon the steel,",modern_nature
"Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,",modern_nature
Odd crumbs of melting snow.,modern_nature
"But you mistake, it is not from the sky;",modern_nature
"From out the iron, and from out the steel,",modern_nature
"Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,",modern_nature
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth,modern_nature
"Along the iron, to the living steel",modern_nature
"In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow",modern_nature
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.,modern_nature
"Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,",modern_nature
"Iron-breaking,",modern_nature
The rusty swords of almond-trees.,modern_nature
"Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.",modern_nature
"They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages",modern_nature
"Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,",modern_nature
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet,modern_nature
"The heart of blossom,",modern_nature
The unquenchable heart of blossom!,modern_nature
"Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,",modern_nature
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon,modern_nature
From the small wound-stump.,modern_nature
"Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree",modern_nature
"Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.",modern_nature
"And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!",modern_nature
"This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,",modern_nature
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees,modern_nature
"Iron, but unforgotten,",modern_nature
"Iron, dawn-hearted,",modern_nature
"Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.",modern_nature
See it come forth in blossom,modern_nature
From the snow-remembering heart,modern_nature
"In long-nighted January,",modern_nature
"In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.",modern_nature
Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane,modern_nature
"Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.",modern_nature
"Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom",modern_nature
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!,modern_nature
"Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,",modern_nature
"Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,",modern_nature
So that the faith in his heart smiles again,modern_nature
"And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,",modern_nature
"And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,",modern_nature
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud,modern_nature
"And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride",modern_nature
"A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,",modern_nature
"Frail-naked, utterly uncovered",modern_nature
"To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind",modern_nature
And January's loud-seeming sun.,modern_nature
"Think of it, from the iron fastness",modern_nature
"Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.",modern_nature
"Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,",modern_nature
"With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.",modern_nature
"Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,",modern_nature
"Come forth from iron,",modern_nature
Red your heart is.,modern_nature
"Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,",modern_nature
"More fearless than iron all the time,",modern_nature
"And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.",modern_nature
"In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,",modern_nature
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.,modern_nature
In the garden raying out,modern_nature
"With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about",modern_nature
"With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,",modern_nature
Sword-blade-born.,modern_nature
"Unpromised,",modern_nature
No bounds being set.,modern_nature
"Flaked out and come unpromised,",modern_nature
"The tree being life-divine,",modern_nature
"Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core",modern_nature
Within iron and earth.,modern_nature
"Knots of pink, fish-silvery",modern_nature
"In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,",modern_nature
"Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,",modern_nature
"Red at the core,",modern_nature
"Red at the core,",modern_nature
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.,modern_nature
"Open,",modern_nature
"Open,",modern_nature
"Five times wide open,",modern_nature
"Six times wide open,",modern_nature
"And given, and perfect;",modern_nature
"And red at the core with the last sore-heartedness,",modern_nature
Sore-hearted-looking.,modern_nature
"At evening, sitting on this terrace,",modern_nature
"When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara",modern_nature
"Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...",modern_nature
When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing,modern_nature
Brown hills surrounding ...,modern_nature
When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio,modern_nature
"A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,",modern_nature
Against the current of obscure Arno ...,modern_nature
"Look up, and you see things flying",modern_nature
Between the day and the night;,modern_nature
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.,modern_nature
"A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches",modern_nature
Where light pushes through;,modern_nature
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.,modern_nature
A dip to the water.,modern_nature
And you think:,modern_nature
The swallows are flying so late!,modern_nature
Swallows?,modern_nature
Dark air-life looping,modern_nature
Yet missing the pure loop ...,modern_nature
"A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight",modern_nature
"And serrated wings against the sky,",modern_nature
"Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,",modern_nature
And falling back.,modern_nature
Never swallows!,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
The swallows are gone.,modern_nature
At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats,modern_nature
By the Ponte Vecchio ...,modern_nature
Changing guard.,modern_nature
"Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp",modern_nature
As the bats swoop overhead!,modern_nature
Flying madly.,modern_nature
Pipistrello!,modern_nature
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.,modern_nature
"Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;",modern_nature
Wings like bits of umbrella.,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
"Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;",modern_nature
And disgustingly upside down.,modern_nature
Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags,modern_nature
And grinning in their sleep.,modern_nature
Bats!,modern_nature
In China the bat is symbol for happiness.,modern_nature
Not for me!Notes:,modern_nature
"Then you shall see her truly--your blood remembering its first invasion of her secrecy, its first encounters with her kind, her chieftain lover...his shade that haunts the lakes and hills",modern_nature
The bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln Park,modern_nature
Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr by in long processions going somewhere to keep apppointment for dinner and matinees and buying and selling,modern_nature
Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling,modern_nature
On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by,modern_nature
I have seen the general dare the combers come closer,modern_nature
And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs and guns of the storm.,modern_nature
I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow is falling.,modern_nature
"Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow, his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies crying forty thousand men are dead along the Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar of the city at his bronze feet.",modern_nature
"A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight and into the dawn.",modern_nature
Not in that wasted garden,modern_nature
Where bodies are drawn into grass,modern_nature
"That feeds no flocks, and into evergreens",modern_nature
That bear no fruit ,modern_nature
There where along the shaded walks,modern_nature
"Vain sighs are heard,",modern_nature
And vainer dreams are dreamed,modern_nature
Of close communion with departed souls ,modern_nature
But here under the apple tree,modern_nature
I loved and watched and pruned,modern_nature
With gnarled hands,modern_nature
"In the long, long years;",modern_nature
Here under the roots of this northern-spy,modern_nature
"To move in the chemic change and circle of life,",modern_nature
"Into the soil and into the flesh of the tree,",modern_nature
And into the living epitaphs,modern_nature
"Of redder apples!What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern_nature
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern_nature
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern_nature
To my heart's delight?,modern_nature
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern_nature
In the west I see a redness come,modern_nature
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern_nature
'Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern_nature
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern_nature
Calling low to her lover:,modern_nature
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern_nature
Has poised above her lips in play,modern_nature
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern_nature
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern_nature
" She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern_nature
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern_nature
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern_nature
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern_nature
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern_nature
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern_nature
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern_nature
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern_nature
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern_nature
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern_nature
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern_nature
"Her small head, making warm display",modern_nature
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern_nature
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern_nature
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern_nature
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern_nature
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern_nature
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern_nature
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern_nature
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern_nature
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern_nature
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern_nature
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern_nature
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern_nature
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern_nature
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern_nature
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern_nature
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern_nature
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern_nature
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern_nature
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern_nature
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern_nature
Should I not answer to his talk,modern_nature
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern_nature
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern_nature
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern_nature
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern_nature
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern_nature
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern_nature
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern_nature
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern_nature
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern_nature
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern_nature
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern_nature
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern_nature
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern_nature
I only know I let him finger there,modern_nature
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern_nature
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern_nature
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern_nature
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern_nature
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern_nature
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern_nature
"Within him, die, and find death good.",modern_nature
"See, the grass is full of stars,",modern_nature
Fallen in their brightness;,modern_nature
"Hearts they have of shining gold,",modern_nature
Rays of shining whiteness.,modern_nature
"Buttercups have honeyed hearts,",modern_nature
"Bees they love the clover,",modern_nature
But I love the daisies' dance,modern_nature
All the meadow over.,modern_nature
"Blow, O blow, you happy winds,",modern_nature
"Singing summer's praises,",modern_nature
Up the field and down the field,modern_nature
A-dancing with the daisies.,modern_nature
"This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,",modern_nature
"Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,",modern_nature
Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between,modern_nature
"Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.",modern_nature
"I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration",modern_nature
"Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze",modern_nature
"Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,",modern_nature
Faces of people streaming across my gaze.,modern_nature
"And I, what fountain of fire am I among",modern_nature
This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed,modern_nature
About like a shadow buffeted in the throng,modern_nature
"Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost.I never knew the earth had so much gold",modern_nature
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern_nature
"Hoary and old,",modern_nature
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern_nature
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern_nature
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern_nature
"This fringe of wood,",modern_nature
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern_nature
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern_nature
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern_nature
"You turned to me,",modern_nature
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern_nature
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern_nature
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern_nature
And you become,modern_nature
A goddess standing in a world of fire!The fog comes,modern_nature
on little cat feet.,modern_nature
It sits looking,modern_nature
over harbor and city,modern_nature
on silent haunches,modern_nature
and then moves on.,modern_nature
When she rises in the morning,modern_nature
I linger to watch her;,modern_nature
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern_nature
And the sunbeams catch her,modern_nature
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern_nature
While down her sides the mellow,modern_nature
Golden shadow glows as,modern_nature
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern_nature
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern_nature
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern_nature
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern_nature
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern_nature
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern_nature
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern_nature
In the window full of sunlight,modern_nature
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern_nature
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern_nature
"Mellow as the glory roses.Pray why are you so bare, so bare,",modern_nature
"Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;",modern_nature
"And why, when I go through the shade you throw,",modern_nature
Runs a shudder over me?,modern_nature
"My leaves were green as the best, I trow,",modern_nature
"And sap ran free in my veins,",modern_nature
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird,modern_nature
A guiltless victim's pains.,modern_nature
I bent me down to hear his sigh;,modern_nature
"I shook with his gurgling moan,",modern_nature
"And I trembled sore when they rode away,",modern_nature
And left him here alone.,modern_nature
"They'd charged him with the old, old crime,",modern_nature
And set him fast in jail:,modern_nature
"Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,",modern_nature
And why does the night wind wail?,modern_nature
"He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,",modern_nature
And he raised his hand to the sky;,modern_nature
"But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,",modern_nature
And the steady tread drew nigh.,modern_nature
"Who is it rides by night, by night,",modern_nature
Over the moonlit road?,modern_nature
"And what is the spur that keeps the pace,",modern_nature
What is the galling goad?,modern_nature
"And now they beat at the prison door,",modern_nature
"Ho, keeper, do not stay!",modern_nature
"We are friends of him whom you hold within,",modern_nature
And we fain would take him away,modern_nature
From those who ride fast on our heels,modern_nature
With mind to do him wrong;,modern_nature
"They have no care for his innocence,",modern_nature
And the rope they bear is long.,modern_nature
"They have fooled the jailer with lying words,",modern_nature
They have fooled the man with lies;,modern_nature
"The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,",modern_nature
And the great door open flies.,modern_nature
"Now they have taken him from the jail,",modern_nature
"And hard and fast they ride,",modern_nature
"And the leader laughs low down in his throat,",modern_nature
As they halt my trunk beside.,modern_nature
"Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,",modern_nature
"And the doctor one of white,",modern_nature
"And the minister, with his oldest son,",modern_nature
Was curiously bedight.,modern_nature
"Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?",modern_nature
"'Tis but a little space,",modern_nature
And the time will come when these shall dread,modern_nature
The mem'ry of your face.,modern_nature
"I feel the rope against my bark,",modern_nature
"And the weight of him in my grain,",modern_nature
I feel in the throe of his final woe,modern_nature
The touch of my own last pain.,modern_nature
And never more shall leaves come forth,modern_nature
On the bough that bears the ban;,modern_nature
"I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,",modern_nature
From the curse of a guiltless man.,modern_nature
"And ever the judge rides by, rides by,",modern_nature
"And goes to hunt the deer,",modern_nature
And ever another rides his soul,modern_nature
In the guise of a mortal fear.,modern_nature
"And ever the man he rides me hard,",modern_nature
And never a night stays he;,modern_nature
"For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,",modern_nature
On the trunk of a haunted tree.When I am dead and over me bright April,modern_nature
"Shakes out her rain-drenched hair,",modern_nature
"Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted,",modern_nature
I shall not care.,modern_nature
"I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful",modern_nature
"When rain bends down the bough,",modern_nature
And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted,modern_nature

old balloonman whistles,modern_nature
far and wee,modern_nature
and bettyandisbel come dancing,modern_nature
from hop-scotch and jump-rope and,modern_nature
it's spring and the goat-footed balloonMan whistles,modern_nature
"I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,",modern_nature
"And a small cabin build there, of clay and wattles made;",modern_nature
"Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,",modern_nature
And live alone in the bee-loud glade.,modern_nature
"And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,",modern_nature
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;,modern_nature
"There midnights all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,",modern_nature
And evening full of the linnets wings.,modern_nature
"I will arise and go now, for always night and day",modern_nature
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;,modern_nature
"While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,",modern_nature
I hear it in the deep hearts core.,modern_nature
little tree,modern_nature
little silent Christmas tree,modern_nature
you are so little,modern_nature
you are more like a flower,modern_nature
who found you in the green forest,modern_nature
and were you very sorry to come away?,modern_nature
see i will comfort you,modern_nature
because you smell so sweetly,modern_nature
i will kiss your cool bark,modern_nature
and hug you safe and tight,modern_nature
"just as your mother would,",modern_nature
only don't be afraid,modern_nature
look the spangles,modern_nature
that sleep all the year in a dark box,modern_nature
"dreaming of being taken out and allowed to shine,",modern_nature
"the balls the chains red and gold the fluffy threads,",modern_nature
put up your little arms,modern_nature
and i'll give them all to you to hold,modern_nature
every finger shall have its ring,modern_nature
and there won't be a single place dark or unhappy,modern_nature
then when you're quite dressed,modern_nature
you'll stand in the window for everyone to see,modern_nature
and how they'll stare!,modern_nature
oh but you'll be very proud,modern_nature
and my little sister and i will take hands,modern_nature
and looking up at our beautiful tree,modern_nature
we'll dance and sing,modern_nature
Rugged and straight he stood; his body steeled,modern_nature
With stubbornness and age. We met his eyes,modern_nature
"That never flinched or turned to compromise,",modern_nature
"And Luck, he cried, good luck!and waved an arm,",modern_nature
"Knotted and sailor-like, such as no farm",modern_nature
In all of Maine could boast of; and away,modern_nature
He turned again to pitch his new-cut hay...,modern_nature
We walked on leisurely until a bend,modern_nature
"Showed him once more, now working toward the end",modern_nature
Of one great path; wearing his eighty years,modern_nature
Like banners lifted in a wind of cheers.,modern_nature
Then we turned off abruptlytook the road,modern_nature
"Cutting the village, the one with the commanding",modern_nature
View of the river. And we strode,modern_nature
More briskly now to the long pier that showed,modern_nature
Where the frail boats were kept at Indian Landing.,modern_nature
In the canoe we stepped; our paddles dipped,modern_nature
"Leisurely downwards, and the slim bark slipped",modern_nature
More on than in the water. Smoothly then,modern_nature
"We shot its nose against the rippling current,",modern_nature
Feeling the rising rivers half-deterrent,modern_nature
Pull on the paddle as we turned the blade,modern_nature
To keep from swerving round; while we delayed,modern_nature
To watch the curious wave-eaten locks;,modern_nature
"Or pass, with lazy turns, the picnic-rocks....",modern_nature
"Blue eels flew under us, and fishes darted",modern_nature
A thousand ways; the once broad channel shrunk.,modern_nature
And over us the wise and noble-hearted,modern_nature
"Twilight leaned down; the sunset mists were parted,",modern_nature
"And we, with thoughts on tiptoe, slunk",modern_nature
"Down the green, twisting alleys of the Kennebunk,",modern_nature
Motionless in the meadows,modern_nature
"The trees, the rocks, the cows...",modern_nature
And quiet dripped from the shadows,modern_nature
Like rain from heavy boughs.,modern_nature
The tree-toads started ringing,modern_nature
Their ceaseless silver bells;,modern_nature
A land-locked breeze came swinging,modern_nature
Its censer of earthy smells.,modern_nature
The rivers tiny canon,modern_nature
Stretched into dusky lands;,modern_nature
Like a dark and silent companion,modern_nature
Evening held out her hands.,modern_nature
Hushed were the dawns bravados;,modern_nature
Loud noon was a silenced cry,modern_nature
And quiet slipped from the shadows,modern_nature
As stars slip out of the sky...,modern_nature
"It must have been an hour more, or later,",modern_nature
"When, tramping homeward through the piney wood,",modern_nature
We felt the years fly back; the brotherhood,modern_nature
Of forests took usand we saw the satyr!,modern_nature
"There in a pool, up to his neck, he stood",modern_nature
"And grinned to see us stare, incredulous",modern_nature
Too startled to remember fear or flight.,modern_nature
"Feeling the menace in the crafty night,",modern_nature
"We turned to runwhen lo, he called to us!",modern_nature
Using our very names he called. We drew,modern_nature
With creaking courage down the avenue,modern_nature
"Of birches till we saw, with clearing sight,",modern_nature
"(No longer through a tricky, pale-green light)",modern_nature
"Familiar turns and shrubs, the friendly path,",modern_nature
And Farmer Boothby in his woodland bath!,modern_nature
The woods became his background; every tree,modern_nature
"Seemed part of him, and stood erect, and shared",modern_nature
The beauty of that gnarled serenity;,modern_nature
The quiet vigor of age that smiled and squared,modern_nature
Its shoulders against Time ... And even night,modern_nature
"Flowed in and out of him, as though content",modern_nature
With such a native element;,modern_nature
Happy to move about a spirit quite,modern_nature
"As old, as placid and as confident...",modern_nature
Sideways we turned. Still glistening and unclad,modern_nature
"He leaped up on the bank, light as a lad,",modern_nature
His body in the moonlight dripping stars...,modern_nature
"We went on homeward, through the pasture-bars.Moonmoth and grasshopper that flee our page",modern_nature
"And still wing on, untarnished of the name",modern_nature
We pinion to your bodies to assuage,modern_nature
Our envy of your freedomwe must maim,modern_nature
"Because we are usurpers, and chagrined",modern_nature
And take the wing and scar it in the hand.,modern_nature
"Names we have, even, to clap on the wind;",modern_nature
"But we must die, as you, to understand.",modern_nature
"I dreamed that all men dropped their names, and sang",modern_nature
"As only they can praise, who build their days",modern_nature
"With fin and hoof, with wing and sweetened fang",modern_nature
Struck free and holy in one Name always.,modern_nature
She has no need to fear the fall,modern_nature
Of harvest from the laddered reach,modern_nature
"Of orchards, nor the tide gone ebbing",modern_nature
From the steep beach.,modern_nature
Nor hold to pain's effrontery,modern_nature
"Her body's bulwark, stern and savage,",modern_nature
"Nor be a glass, where to forsee",modern_nature
Another's ravage.,modern_nature
"What she has gathered, and what lost,",modern_nature
She will not find to lose again.,modern_nature
"She is possessed by time, who once",modern_nature
Was loved by men.,modern_nature
The winter evening settles down,modern_nature
With smell of steaks in passageways.,modern_nature
Six oclock.,modern_nature
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.,modern_nature
And now a gusty shower wraps,modern_nature
The grimy scraps,modern_nature
Of withered leaves about your feet,modern_nature
And newspapers from vacant lots;,modern_nature
The showers beat,modern_nature
"On broken blinds and chimney-pots,",modern_nature
And at the corner of the street,modern_nature
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.,modern_nature
And then the lighting of the lamps.,modern_nature
The morning comes to consciousness,modern_nature
Of faint stale smells of beer,modern_nature
From the sawdust-trampled street,modern_nature
With all its muddy feet that press,modern_nature
To early coffee-stands.,modern_nature
With the other masquerades,modern_nature
"That time resumes,",modern_nature
One thinks of all the hands,modern_nature
That are raising dingy shades,modern_nature
In a thousand furnished rooms.,modern_nature
"You tossed a blanket from the bed,",modern_nature
"You lay upon your back, and waited;",modern_nature
"You dozed, and watched the night revealing",modern_nature
The thousand sordid images,modern_nature
Of which your soul was constituted;,modern_nature
They flickered against the ceiling.,modern_nature
And when all the world came back,modern_nature
And the light crept up between the shutters,modern_nature
"And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,",modern_nature
You had such a vision of the street,modern_nature
As the street hardly understands;,modern_nature
"Sitting along the beds edge, where",modern_nature
"You curled the papers from your hair,",modern_nature
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet,modern_nature
In the palms of both soiled hands.,modern_nature
His soul stretched tight across the skies,modern_nature
"That fade behind a city block,",modern_nature
Or trampled by insistent feet,modern_nature
At four and five and six oclock;,modern_nature
"And short square fingers stuffing pipes,",modern_nature
"And evening newspapers, and eyes",modern_nature
"Assured of certain certainties,",modern_nature
The conscience of a blackened street,modern_nature
Impatient to assume the world.,modern_nature
I am moved by fancies that are curled,modern_nature
"Around these images, and cling:",modern_nature
The notion of some infinitely gentle,modern_nature
Infinitely suffering thing.,modern_nature
"Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;",modern_nature
The worlds revolve like ancient women,modern_nature
"Gathering fuel in vacant lots.The willows carried a slow sound,",modern_nature
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.,modern_nature
I could never remember,modern_nature
"That seething, steady leveling of the marshes",modern_nature
Till age had brought me to the sea.,modern_nature
"Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves",modern_nature
Where cypresses shared the noons,modern_nature
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.,modern_nature
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams,modern_nature
"Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them",modern_nature
Asunder ...,modern_nature
How much I would have bartered! the black gorge,modern_nature
And all the singular nestings in the hills,modern_nature
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.,modern_nature
The pond I entered once and quickly fled,modern_nature
I remember now its singing willow rim.,modern_nature
"And finally, in that memory all things nurse;",modern_nature
After the city that I finally passed,modern_nature
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts,modern_nature
The monsoon cut across the delta,modern_nature
"At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes",modern_nature
"I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,",modern_nature
And willows could not hold more steady sound.Twelve o'clock.,modern_nature
Along the reaches of the street,modern_nature
"Held in a lunar synthesis,",modern_nature
Whispering lunar incantations,modern_nature
Dissolve the floors of memory,modern_nature
"And all its clear relations,",modern_nature
"Its divisions and precisions,",modern_nature
Every street lamp that I pass,modern_nature
"Beats like a fatalistic drum,",modern_nature
And through the spaces of the dark,modern_nature
Midnight shakes the memory,modern_nature
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.,modern_nature
"Half-past one,",modern_nature
"The street lamp sputtered,",modern_nature
"The street lamp muttered,",modern_nature
"The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman",modern_nature
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door,modern_nature
Which opens on her like a grin.,modern_nature
You see the border of her dress,modern_nature
"Is torn and stained with sand,",modern_nature
And you see the corner of her eye,modern_nature
"Twists like a crooked pin.""",modern_nature
The memory throws up high and dry,modern_nature
A crowd of twisted things;,modern_nature
A twisted branch upon the beach,modern_nature
"Eaten smooth, and polished",modern_nature
As if the world gave up,modern_nature
"The secret of its skeleton,",modern_nature
Stiff and white.,modern_nature
"A broken spring in a factory yard,",modern_nature
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left,modern_nature
Hard and curled and ready to snap.,modern_nature
"Half-past two,",modern_nature
"The street lamp said,",modern_nature
"Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.",modern_nature
"So the hand of a child, automatic,",modern_nature
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.,modern_nature
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.,modern_nature
I have seen eyes in the street,modern_nature
"Trying to peer through lighted shutters,",modern_nature
"And a crab one afternoon in a pool,",modern_nature
"An old crab with barnacles on his back,",modern_nature
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.,modern_nature
"Half-past three,",modern_nature
"The lamp sputtered,",modern_nature
The lamp muttered in the dark.,modern_nature
The lamp hummed:,modern_nature
Regard the moon,modern_nature
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,modern_nature
She winks a feeble eye,modern_nature
She smiles into corners.,modern_nature
She smoothes the hair of the grass.,modern_nature
The moon has lost her memory.,modern_nature
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,modern_nature
Her hand twists a paper rose,modern_nature
That smells of dust and old Cologne,modern_nature
She is alone,modern_nature
With all the old nocturnal smells,modern_nature
That cross and cross across her brain.,modern_nature
The reminiscence comes,modern_nature
Of sunless dry geraniums,modern_nature
"And dust in crevices,",modern_nature
"Smells of chestnuts in the streets,",modern_nature
"And female smells in shuttered rooms,",modern_nature
And cigarettes in corridors,modern_nature
"And cocktail smells in bars.""",modern_nature
"The lamp said,",modern_nature
"Four o'clock,",modern_nature
Here is the number on the door.,modern_nature
Memory!,modern_nature
"You have the key,",modern_nature
"The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,",modern_nature
Mount.,modern_nature
"The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,",modern_nature
"Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.",modern_nature
The last twist of the knife.,modern_nature
"Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,",modern_nature
"Out of the loud foam,",modern_nature
He has put in to a great quiet,modern_nature
And a still home.,modern_nature
Here he may lie at ease and wonder,modern_nature
"Why the old ship waits,",modern_nature
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder,modern_nature
"Of the full Straits,",modern_nature
"And look for the fishing fleet at morning,",modern_nature
"Shadows like lost souls,",modern_nature
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning,modern_nature
"Betrays the shoals,",modern_nature
And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing,modern_nature
"Out of the bright West,",modern_nature
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining,modern_nature
"Like a tern's breast, ",modern_nature
And never know he is done for ever,modern_nature
"With the old sea's pride,",modern_nature
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour,modern_nature
"On an ebb tide.Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",modern_nature

In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,modern_nature
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",modern_nature
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,modern_nature
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",modern_nature
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern_nature
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",modern_nature

Ere they were born.,modern_nature

And the dust of the leaf.,modern_nature
Pride of the sword and power,modern_nature
Are theirs at their need,modern_nature
Who shall rule but the root of the flower,modern_nature
The fall of the seed.,modern_nature
They who follow the flesh,modern_nature
"In splendour and tears,",modern_nature

In the fulness of years.,modern_nature

Hardship endured oft.,modern_nature

"Known on my keel many a care's hold,",modern_nature
"And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent",modern_nature
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head,modern_nature
"While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,",modern_nature
My feet were by frost benumbed.,modern_nature
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs,modern_nature
Hew my heart round and hunger begot,modern_nature
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not,modern_nature

"Weathered the winter, wretched outcast",modern_nature
Deprived of my kinsmen;,modern_nature
"Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,",modern_nature
There I heard naught save the harsh sea,modern_nature

"Did for my games the gannet's clamour,",modern_nature
"Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,",modern_nature
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.,modern_nature
"Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern",modern_nature
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed,modern_nature
With spray on his pinion.,modern_nature
Not any protector,modern_nature

"He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having",modern_nature

Where I can hear a solemn booming gun,modern_nature
"And catch the gleaming of a random light,",modern_nature

My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;,modern_nature

And the children know,modern_nature
I am fooling.Green miles of leafy peace are spread,modern_nature
"Over these ranks, unseen and serried;",modern_nature
Screening the trenches with their dead,modern_nature
And living men already buried.,modern_nature
"The rains beat down, the torrents flow",modern_nature
Into each cold and huddling cave;,modern_nature
"And over them the beet-fields grow,",modern_nature
A fortress gentle as a grave.,modern_nature
"Morose, impatient, sick at heart,",modern_nature
"With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,",modern_nature
We cannot even sleep; we start,modern_nature
With every twig that snaps or rustles.,modern_nature
Sought always by an unseen foe,modern_nature
Over our heads the bullets fly;,modern_nature
"But more than these, we fear the snow,",modern_nature
The silent shrapnel of the sky.,modern_nature
"Yonder our colonel stalks and grieves,",modern_nature
Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;,modern_nature
"But we, we sit and watch the leaves",modern_nature
"Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.",modern_nature
"We mourn for every leaf that lies,",modern_nature
As though it were a comrade slain;,modern_nature
Each was a shelter from the eyes,modern_nature
Of every prying aeroplane. . . ,modern_nature
"And in its cloudy uniform,",modern_nature
"Stilling the cannons earthly thunder,",modern_nature
The huge artillery of the storm,modern_nature
Plows through the land and pulls it under.,modern_nature
"The rain beats down, until the slow",modern_nature
And slipping earth resists no more. . .,modern_nature
And over them the beets will grow,modern_nature
Ranker and redder than before.,modern_nature
"The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,",modern_nature
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;,modern_nature
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",modern_nature
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.,modern_nature
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",modern_nature
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.,modern_nature
"Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I",modern_nature
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.,modern_nature
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern_nature
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern_nature
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern_nature
"Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.",modern_nature
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern_nature
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,",modern_nature
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",modern_nature
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,modern_nature
What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?,modern_nature
"Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!",modern_nature
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed,modern_nature
"Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.",modern_nature
"So my soul like a passionate woman turns,",modern_nature
"Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love",modern_nature
"For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,",modern_nature
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.,modern_nature
"Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,",modern_nature
"Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",modern_nature
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare,modern_nature
"Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.",modern_nature
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",modern_nature
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,",modern_nature
"Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,",modern_nature
"Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.",modern_nature
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping,modern_nature
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;,modern_nature
"Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:",modern_nature
"They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.",modern_nature
"Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie",modern_nature
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.,modern_nature
"Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I",modern_nature
"Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!",modern_nature
"The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes",modern_nature
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;,modern_nature
There the lazy streamlet pushes,modern_nature
"His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes",modern_nature
"Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,",modern_nature
"Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;",modern_nature
"Naked on the steep, soft lip",modern_nature
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.,modern_nature
"What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?",modern_nature
"What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?",modern_nature
What is this thing that I look down upon?,modern_nature
"White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.",modern_nature
"How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!",modern_nature
"I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!",modern_nature
"And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,",modern_nature
"And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.",modern_nature
"But how splendid it is to be substance, here!",modern_nature
"My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!",modern_nature
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!,modern_nature
Here! flick the rabbits. Here! pants the gorse. Here! say the insects far and near.,modern_nature
"Over my skin in the sunshine, the warm, clinging air",modern_nature
"Flushed with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.",modern_nature
You are here! You are here! We have found you! Everywhere,modern_nature
"We sought you substantial, you touchstone of caresses, you naked lad!",modern_nature
"Oh but the water loves me and folds me,",modern_nature
"Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me, murmurs: Oh marvellous stuff!",modern_nature
No longer shadow!  and it holds me,modern_nature
"Close, and it rolls me, enfolds me, touches me, as if never it could touch me enough.",modern_nature
"Sun, but in substance, yellow water-blobs!",modern_nature
"Wings and feathers on the crying, mysterious ages, peewits wheeling!",modern_nature
"All that is right, all that is good; all that is God takes substance! a rabbit lobs",modern_nature
"In confirmation, I hear sevenfold lark-songs pealing.The trees are in their autumn beauty,",modern_nature
"The woodland paths are dry,",modern_nature
Under the October twilight the water,modern_nature
Mirrors a still sky;,modern_nature
Upon the brimming water among the stones,modern_nature
Are nine-and-fifty swans.,modern_nature
The nineteenth autumn has come upon me,modern_nature
Since I first made my count;,modern_nature
"I saw, before I had well finished,",modern_nature
All suddenly mount,modern_nature
And scatter wheeling in great broken rings,modern_nature
Upon their clamorous wings.,modern_nature
"I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,",modern_nature
And now my heart is sore.,modern_nature
"All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,",modern_nature
"The first time on this shore,",modern_nature
"The bell-beat of their wings above my head,",modern_nature
Trod with a lighter tread.,modern_nature
"Unwearied still, lover by lover,",modern_nature
They paddle in the cold,modern_nature
Companionable streams or climb the air;,modern_nature
Their hearts have not grown old;,modern_nature
"Passion or conquest, wander where they will,",modern_nature
Attend upon them still.,modern_nature
"But now they drift on the still water,",modern_nature
"Mysterious, beautiful;",modern_nature
"Among what rushes will they build,",modern_nature
By what lake's edge or pool,modern_nature
Delight men's eyes when I awake some day,modern_nature
"To find they have flown away?Give me hunger,",modern_nature
O you gods that sit and give,modern_nature
The world its orders.,modern_nature
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern_nature
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern_nature
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern_nature
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern_nature
"But leave me a little love,",modern_nature
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern_nature
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern_nature
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern_nature
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern_nature
"Blurring the sunset,",modern_nature
"One little wandering, western star",modern_nature
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern_nature
"Let me go to the window,",modern_nature
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern_nature
And wait and know the coming,modern_nature
"Of a little love.Passing through huddled and ugly walls,",modern_nature
By doorways where women haggard,modern_nature
"Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,",modern_nature
"Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,",modern_nature
"Out from the huddled and ugly walls,",modern_nature
"I came sudden, at the city's edge,",modern_nature
"On a blue burst of lake,",modern_nature
Long lake waves breaking under the sun,modern_nature
On a spray-flung curve of shore;,modern_nature
"And a fluttering storm of gulls,",modern_nature
Masses of great gray wings,modern_nature
And flying white bellies,modern_nature
Veering and wheeling free in the open.Desolate and lone,modern_nature
All night long on the lake,modern_nature
"Where fog trails and mist creeps,",modern_nature
The whistle of a boat,modern_nature
"Calls and cries unendingly,",modern_nature
Like some lost child,modern_nature
In tears and trouble,modern_nature
Hunting the harbor's breast,modern_nature
"And the harbor's eyes.Momus is the name men give your face,",modern_nature
"The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",modern_nature
"Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",modern_nature
"Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",modern_nature
"Yes, Momus,",modern_nature
Men have flung your face in bronze,modern_nature
To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.,modern_nature
"They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",modern_nature
"Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",modern_nature
All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones,modern_nature
"Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",modern_nature
"I wonder, Momus,",modern_nature
Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter,modern_nature
"On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",modern_nature
"A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",modern_nature
"You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",modern_nature
"Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",modern_nature
Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women,modern_nature
"Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",modern_nature
And blood drops of undiminishing war.I shall foot it,modern_nature
"Down the roadway in the dusk,",modern_nature
Where shapes of hunger wander,modern_nature
And the fugitives of pain go by.,modern_nature
I shall foot it,modern_nature
"In the silence of the morning,",modern_nature
"See the night slur into dawn,",modern_nature
Hear the slow great winds arise,modern_nature
Where tall trees flank the way,modern_nature
And shoulder toward the sky.,modern_nature
The broken boulders by the road,modern_nature
Shall not commemorate my ruin.,modern_nature
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.,modern_nature
I shall watch for,modern_nature
Slim birds swift of wing,modern_nature
That go where wind and ranks of thunder,modern_nature
Drive the wild processionals of rain.,modern_nature
The dust of the travelled road,modern_nature
"Shall touch my hands and face.I have sat here happy in the gardens,",modern_nature
Watching the still pool and the reeds,modern_nature
And the dark clouds,modern_nature
Which the wind of the upper air,modern_nature
Tore like the green leafy boughs,modern_nature
Of the divers-hued trees of late summer;,modern_nature
But though I greatly delight,modern_nature
"In these and the water-lilies,",modern_nature
That which sets me nighest to weeping,modern_nature
"Is the rose and white color of the smooth flag-stones,",modern_nature
And the pale yellow grasses,modern_nature
"Among them.Potuia, potuia",modern_nature
"White grave goddess,",modern_nature
"Pity my sadness,",modern_nature
O silence of Paros.,modern_nature
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern_nature
These garments and decorum;,modern_nature
"I am thy brother,",modern_nature
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern_nature
And thou hearest me not.,modern_nature
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern_nature
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern_nature
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern_nature
When the fragile pipes,modern_nature
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern_nature
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern_nature
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern_nature
And only the cicada sang.,modern_nature
I have told thee of the hills,modern_nature
And the lisp of reeds,modern_nature
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern_nature
"And thou hearest me not,",modern_nature
"Potuia, potuia",modern_nature
Thou hearest me not.The ancient songs,modern_nature
Pass deathward mournfully.,modern_nature
"Cold lips that sing no more, and withered wreaths,",modern_nature
"Regretful eyes, and drooping breasts and wings",modern_nature
Symbols of ancient songs,modern_nature
Mournfully passing,modern_nature
"Down to the great white surges,",modern_nature
Watched of none         - -,modern_nature
Save the frail sea-birds,modern_nature
"And the lithe pale girls,",modern_nature
Daughters of Okeanos.,modern_nature
And the songs pass,modern_nature
From the green land,modern_nature
Which lies upon the waves as a leaf,modern_nature
On the flowers of hyacinth;,modern_nature
"And they pass from the waters,",modern_nature
"The manifold winds and the dim moon,",modern_nature
"And they come,",modern_nature
"Silently winging through soft Kimmerian dusk,",modern_nature
To the quiet level lands,modern_nature
"That she keeps for us all,",modern_nature
That she wrought for us all for sleep,modern_nature
In the silver days of the earth's dawning,modern_nature
"Proserpine, daughter of Zeus.",modern_nature
"And we turn from the Kuprian's breasts,",modern_nature
"And we turn from thee,",modern_nature
"Phoibos Apollon,",modern_nature
And we turn from the music of old,modern_nature
"And the hills that we loved and the meads,",modern_nature
"And we turn from the fiery day,",modern_nature
And the lips that were over-sweet;,modern_nature
For silently,modern_nature
"Brushing the fields with red-shod feet,",modern_nature
With purple robe,modern_nature
"Searing the flowers as with a sudden flame,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
Thou hast come upon us.,modern_nature
And of all the ancient songs,modern_nature
Passing to the swallow-blue halls,modern_nature
"By the dark streams of Persephone,",modern_nature
This only remains:,modern_nature
"That in the end we turn to thee,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
"That we turn to thee, singing",modern_nature
One last song.,modern_nature
"O Death,",modern_nature
Thou art an healing wind,modern_nature
That blowest over white flowers,modern_nature
A-tremble with dew;,modern_nature
Thou art a wind flowing,modern_nature
Over long leagues of lonely sea;,modern_nature
Thou art the dusk and the fragrance;,modern_nature
Thou art the lips of love mournfully smiling;,modern_nature
Thou art the pale peace of one,modern_nature
Satiate with old desires;,modern_nature
"Thou art the silence of beauty,",modern_nature
And we look no more for the morning;,modern_nature
"We yearn no more for the sun,",modern_nature
"Since with thy white hands,",modern_nature
"Death,",modern_nature
"Thou crownest us with the pallid chaplets,",modern_nature
The slim colorless poppies,modern_nature
Which in thy garden alone,modern_nature
Softly thou gatherest.,modern_nature
And silently;,modern_nature
And with slow feet approaching;,modern_nature
"And with bowed head and unlit eyes,",modern_nature
We kneel before thee:,modern_nature
"And thou, leaning towards us, Caressingly layest upon us",modern_nature
"Flowers from thy thin cold hands,",modern_nature
"And, smiling as a chaste woman Knowing love in her heart,",modern_nature
Thou sealest our eyes,modern_nature
And the illimitable quietude,modern_nature
Comes gently upon us.,modern_nature
"Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,",renaissance_love
"And make me travel forth without my cloak,",renaissance_love
"To let base clouds oertake me in my way,",renaissance_love
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?,renaissance_love
"Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,",renaissance_love
"To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,",renaissance_love
For no man well of such a salve can speak,renaissance_love
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:,renaissance_love
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;,renaissance_love
"Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:",renaissance_love
The offenders sorrow lends but weak relief,renaissance_love
To him that bears the strong offences cross.,renaissance_love
"Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,",renaissance_love
And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.,renaissance_love
"Weret aught to me I bore the canopy,",renaissance_love
"With my extern the outward honouring,",renaissance_love
"Or laid great bases for eternity,",renaissance_love
Which proves more short than waste or ruining;,renaissance_love
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour,renaissance_love
"Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,",renaissance_love
"For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,",renaissance_love
"Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?",renaissance_love
"No;let me be obsequious in thy heart,",renaissance_love
"And take thou my oblation, poor but free,",renaissance_love
"Which is not mixd with seconds, knows no art,",renaissance_love
"But mutual render, only me for thee.",renaissance_love
"Hence, thou subornd informer! a true soul,",renaissance_love
"When most impeachd, stands least in thy control. ",renaissance_love
Let the bird of loudest lay,renaissance_love
On the sole Arabian tree,renaissance_love
"Herald sad and trumpet be,",renaissance_love
To whose sound chaste wings obey.,renaissance_love
"But thou shrieking harbinger,",renaissance_love
"Foul precurrer of the fiend,",renaissance_love
"Augur of the fever's end,",renaissance_love
To this troop come thou not near.,renaissance_love
From this session interdict,renaissance_love
"Every fowl of tyrant wing,",renaissance_love
"Save the eagle, feather'd king;",renaissance_love
Keep the obsequy so strict.,renaissance_love
"Let the priest in surplice white,",renaissance_love
"That defunctive music can,",renaissance_love
"Be the death-divining swan,",renaissance_love
Lest the requiem lack his right.,renaissance_love
"And thou treble-dated crow,",renaissance_love
That thy sable gender mak'st,renaissance_love
"With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st,",renaissance_love
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.,renaissance_love
Here the anthem doth commence:,renaissance_love

Phoenix and the Turtle fled,renaissance_love
In a mutual flame from hence.,renaissance_love

Had the essence but in one;,renaissance_love
"Two distincts, division none:",renaissance_love
Number there in love was slain.,renaissance_love
"Hearts remote, yet not asunder;",renaissance_love
Distance and no space was seen,renaissance_love
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:,renaissance_love
But in them it were a wonder.,renaissance_love
So between them love did shine,renaissance_love
That the Turtle saw his right,renaissance_love
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:,renaissance_love
Either was the other's mine.,renaissance_love
Property was thus appalled,renaissance_love
That the self was not the same;,renaissance_love
Single nature's double name,renaissance_love
Neither two nor one was called.,renaissance_love
"Reason, in itself confounded,",renaissance_love
"Saw division grow together,",renaissance_love
"To themselves yet either neither,",renaissance_love
Simple were so well compounded;,renaissance_love
"That it cried, How true a twain",renaissance_love
Seemeth this concordant one!,renaissance_love
"Love has reason, reason none,",renaissance_love
If what parts can so remain.,renaissance_love
Whereupon it made this threne,renaissance_love
"To the Phoenix and the Dove,",renaissance_love
"Co-supremes and stars of love,",renaissance_love
As chorus to their tragic scene:,renaissance_love
"Beauty, truth, and rarity,",renaissance_love
"Grace in all simplicity,",renaissance_love
"Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.",renaissance_love
"Death is now the Phoenix' nest,",renaissance_love
And the Turtle's loyal breast,renaissance_love
"To eternity doth rest,",renaissance_love
Leaving no posterity:,renaissance_love
"'Twas not their infirmity,",renaissance_love
It was married chastity.,renaissance_love
Truth may seem but cannot be;,renaissance_love
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;,renaissance_love
Truth and beauty buried be.,renaissance_love
To this urn let those repair,renaissance_love
That are either true or fair;,renaissance_love
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.,renaissance_love
"Sing lullaby, as women do,",renaissance_love
"Wherewith they bring their babes to rest,",renaissance_love
And lullaby can I sing too,renaissance_love
As womanly as can the best.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby they still the child,",renaissance_love
"And if I be not much beguiled,",renaissance_love
Full many wanton babes have I,renaissance_love
Which must be stilled with lullaby.,renaissance_love
First lullaby my youthful years;,renaissance_love

For crooked age and hoary hairs,renaissance_love
Have won the haven within my head.,renaissance_love
"With lullaby, then, youth be still;",renaissance_love
With lullaby content thy will;,renaissance_love
"Since courage quails and comes behind,",renaissance_love
"Go sleep, and so beguile thy mind.",renaissance_love
"Next, lullaby my gazing eyes,",renaissance_love
Which wonted were to glance apace.,renaissance_love
For every glass may now suffice,renaissance_love
To show the furrows in my face;,renaissance_love
"With lullaby then wink awhile,",renaissance_love
With lullaby your looks beguile;,renaissance_love
Let no fair face nor beauty bright,renaissance_love
Entice you eft with vain delight.,renaissance_love

"But welcome pain, let pleasure pass;",renaissance_love
"With lullaby now take your leave,",renaissance_love
With lullaby your dreams deceive;,renaissance_love
"And when you rise with waking eye,",renaissance_love
Remember then this lullaby.,renaissance_love
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan,renaissance_love
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me:,renaissance_love
"Ist not enough to torture me alone,",renaissance_love
But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be?,renaissance_love
"Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,",renaissance_love
And my next self thou harder hast engrossed;,renaissance_love

But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;,renaissance_love
"Whoeer keeps me, let my heart be his guard:",renaissance_love
Thou canst not then use rigour in my jail.,renaissance_love
"And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,",renaissance_love

That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;,renaissance_love
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;,renaissance_love
"Use power with power, and slay me not by art.",renaissance_love
"Tell me thou lovst elsewhere; but in my sight,",renaissance_love
"Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside;",renaissance_love
What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might,renaissance_love
Is more than my oerpressed defense can bide?,renaissance_love
"Let me excuse thee: ah, my love well knows",renaissance_love
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies;,renaissance_love
"And therefore from my face she turns my foes,",renaissance_love
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries,renaissance_love
"Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,",renaissance_love
Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.,renaissance_love
"Love is my sin, and thy dear virtue hate,",renaissance_love
"Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving.",renaissance_love
"O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,",renaissance_love
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;,renaissance_love
"Or if it do, not from those lips of thine,",renaissance_love
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments,renaissance_love
"And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine,",renaissance_love
Robbed others beds revenues of their rents.,renaissance_love
Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those,renaissance_love
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:,renaissance_love
"Root pity in thy heart, that, when it grows,",renaissance_love

By self-example mayst thou be denied.,renaissance_love

And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;,renaissance_love
"My thoughts and my discourse as madmens are,",renaissance_love
At random from the truth vainly expressed:,renaissance_love
"For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,",renaissance_love
"Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.",renaissance_love
"A Poet am I neither born nor bred,",renaissance_love
But to a witty poet married:,renaissance_love

Where Fancies grow and where the Muses sing.,renaissance_love
"There oft I lean my head, and listening, hark,",renaissance_love
To catch his words and all his fancies mark:,renaissance_love
And from that garden show of beauties take,renaissance_love
Whereof a posy I in verse may make.,renaissance_love
"Thus I, that have no gardens of my own,",renaissance_love
There gather flowers that are newly blown.,renaissance_love
"Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance_love

"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance_love
"I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe,",renaissance_love
"Studying inventions fine, her wits to entertain,",renaissance_love
"Oft turning others leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance_love
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburned brain.,renaissance_love
"But words came halting forth, wanting Inventions stay:",renaissance_love
"Invention, Natures child, fled step-dame Studys blows,",renaissance_love

"The noblest freedom, not to choose",renaissance_love
Against or faith or honors laws.,renaissance_love
"But who should less expect from you,",renaissance_love
In whom alone Love lives again?,renaissance_love
"By whom he is restored to men,",renaissance_love
"And kept, and bred, and brought up true.",renaissance_love
"His falling temples you have reared,",renaissance_love
The withered garlands taen away;,renaissance_love
His altars kept from the decay,renaissance_love
"That envy wished, and nature feared;",renaissance_love
"And on them burn so chaste a flame,",renaissance_love
"With so much loyalties expense,",renaissance_love
"As Love, t acquit such excellence,",renaissance_love
Is gone himself into your name.,renaissance_love
And you are he; the deity,renaissance_love
To whom all lovers are designed,renaissance_love
That would their better objects find;,renaissance_love
Among which faithful troop am I.,renaissance_love
"Who, as an offspring at your shrine,",renaissance_love
"Have sung this hymn, and here entreat",renaissance_love
One spark of your diviner heat,renaissance_love
To light upon a love of mine.,renaissance_love
"Which, if it kindle not, but scant",renaissance_love
"Appear, and that to shortest view,",renaissance_love
Yet give me leave t adore in you,renaissance_love
What I in her am grieved to want.,renaissance_love
"And if I did, what then?",renaissance_love
Are you aggrievd therefore?,renaissance_love
"The sea hath fish for every man,",renaissance_love
And what would you have more?,renaissance_love
"Thus did my mistress once,",renaissance_love
Amaze my mind with doubt;,renaissance_love
And poppd a question for the nonce,renaissance_love
To beat my brains about.,renaissance_love
Whereto I thus replied:,renaissance_love
Each fisherman can wish,renaissance_love
That all the seas at every tide,renaissance_love
Were his alone to fish.,renaissance_love
And so did I (in vain),renaissance_love
"But since it may not be,",renaissance_love
"Let such fish there as find the gain,",renaissance_love
And leave the loss for me.,renaissance_love
And with such luck and loss,renaissance_love
"I will content myself,",renaissance_love
Till tides of turning time may toss,renaissance_love
Such fishers on the shelf.,renaissance_love
"And when they stick on sands,",renaissance_love
"That every man may see,",renaissance_love
"Then will I laugh and clap my hands,",renaissance_love
"As they do now at me.All Kings, and all their favourites,",renaissance_love
"All glory of honours, beauties, wits,",renaissance_love
"The sun itself, which makes times, as they pass,",renaissance_love
Is elder by a year now than it was,renaissance_love
When thou and I first one another saw:,renaissance_love
"All other things to their destruction draw,",renaissance_love
Only our love hath no decay;,renaissance_love
"This no tomorrow hath, nor yesterday,",renaissance_love
"Running it never runs from us away,",renaissance_love
"But truly keeps his first, last, everlasting day.",renaissance_love
Two graves must hide thine and my corse;,renaissance_love
"If one might, death were no divorce.",renaissance_love
"Alas, as well as other Princes, we",renaissance_love
(Who Prince enough in one another be),renaissance_love
"Must leave at last in death these eyes and ears,",renaissance_love
"Oft fed with true oaths, and with sweet salt tears;",renaissance_love
But souls where nothing dwells but love,renaissance_love
(All other thoughts being inmates) then shall prove,renaissance_love
"This, or a love increased there above,",renaissance_love
"When bodies to their graves, souls from their graves remove.",renaissance_love
And then we shall be throughly blessed;,renaissance_love
But we no more than all the rest.,renaissance_love
"Here upon earth were Kings, and none but we",renaissance_love
"Can be such Kings, nor of such subjects be;",renaissance_love
Who is so safe as we? where none can do,renaissance_love
"Treason to us, except one of us two.",renaissance_love
"True and false fears let us refrain,",renaissance_love
"Let us love nobly, and live, and add again",renaissance_love
"Years and years unto years, till we attain",renaissance_love
To write threescore: this is the second of our reign.,renaissance_love
As you came from the holy land,renaissance_love
"Of Walsingham,",renaissance_love
Met you not with my true love,renaissance_love
By the way as you came?,renaissance_love
"How shall I know your true love,",renaissance_love
"That have met many one,",renaissance_love
"I went to the holy land,",renaissance_love
"That have come, that have gone?",renaissance_love
"She is neither white, nor brown,",renaissance_love
But as the heavens fair;,renaissance_love
There is none hath a form so divine,renaissance_love
"In the earth, or the air.",renaissance_love
"Such a one did I meet, good sir,",renaissance_love
"Such an angelic face,",renaissance_love
"Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear",renaissance_love
"By her gait, by her grace.",renaissance_love
"She hath left me here all alone,",renaissance_love
"All alone, as unknown,",renaissance_love
"Who sometimes did me lead with herself,",renaissance_love
And me loved as her own.,renaissance_love
"Whats the cause that she leaves you alone,",renaissance_love
"And a new way doth take,",renaissance_love
"Who loved you once as her own,",renaissance_love
And her joy did you make?,renaissance_love
I have lovd her all my youth;,renaissance_love
"But now old, as you see,",renaissance_love
Love likes not the falling fruit,renaissance_love
From the withered tree.,renaissance_love
"Know that Love is a careless child,",renaissance_love
And forgets promise past;,renaissance_love
"He is blind, he is deaf when he list,",renaissance_love
And in faith never fast.,renaissance_love
"His desire is a dureless content,",renaissance_love
And a trustless joy:,renaissance_love
"He is won with a world of despair,",renaissance_love
And is lost with a toy.,renaissance_love
"Of womenkind such indeed is the love,",renaissance_love
"Or the word love abusd,",renaissance_love
Under which many childish desires,renaissance_love
And conceits are excusd.,renaissance_love
"But true love is a durable fire,",renaissance_love
"In the mind ever burning,",renaissance_love
"Never sick, never old, never dead,",renaissance_love
From itself never turning.,renaissance_love
"Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies",renaissance_love
"Sweetness, that breathes and pants as oft as she;",renaissance_love
"And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries",renaissance_love
That sickness brags itself best graced to be.,renaissance_love
"    Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise",renaissance_love
That in that paleness beautys white we see;,renaissance_love
"And joy, which is inseparate from these eyes,",renaissance_love
Stella now learns (strange case!) to weep in thee.,renaissance_love
"   Love moves thy pain, and like a faithful page,",renaissance_love
"As thy looks stir, runs up and down, to make",renaissance_love
All folks prest at thy will thy pain to assuage;,renaissance_love
"Nature with care sweats for her darlings sake,",renaissance_love
"   Knowing worlds pass, ere she enough can find",renaissance_love
"   Of such heaven stuff, to clothe so heavenly mind.",renaissance_love
"   Where be the roses gone, which sweetened so our eyes?",renaissance_love
"    Where those red cheeks, which oft with fair increase did frame",renaissance_love
    The height of honor in the kindly badge of shame?,renaissance_love
Who hath the crimson weeds stolen from my morning skies?,renaissance_love
"How doth the color vade of those vermilion dyes,",renaissance_love
"    Which Nature's self did make, and self engrained the same!",renaissance_love
    I would know by what right this paleness overcame,renaissance_love
"That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties?",renaissance_love
"    Galen's adoptive sons, who by a beaten way",renaissance_love
"    Their judgements hackney on, the fault on sickness lay;",renaissance_love
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far:,renaissance_love
"    It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white",renaissance_love
"    To write therein more fresh the story of delight,",renaissance_love
Whiles beauty's reddest ink Venus for him doth stir.,renaissance_love
"O absent presence, Stella is not here;",renaissance_love
"    False flattering hope, that with so fair a face",renaissance_love
"    Bare me in hand, that in this orphan place",renaissance_love
"Stella, I say my Stella, should appear.",renaissance_love
What sayst thou now? Where is that dainty cheer,renaissance_love
    Thou toldst mine eyes should help their famished case?,renaissance_love
"    But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace",renaissance_love
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near.,renaissance_love
"    But here I do store of fair ladies meet,",renaissance_love
    Who may with charm of conversation sweet,renaissance_love
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow:,renaissance_love
"    Sure they prevail as much with me, as he",renaissance_love
"    That bade his friend, but then new maimed, to be",renaissance_love
"Merry with him, and not think of his woe.",renaissance_love
"Stella, since thou so right a princess art",renaissance_love
"Of all the powers which life bestows on me,",renaissance_love
There ere by them aught undertaken be,renaissance_love
They first resort unto that sovereign part;,renaissance_love
"Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart,",renaissance_love
"Which pants as though it still should leap to thee,",renaissance_love
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy,renaissance_love
"To this great cause, which needs both use and art,",renaissance_love
"And as a queen, who from her presence sends",renaissance_love
"Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit,",renaissance_love
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends.,renaissance_love
On servants shame oft masters blame doth sit.,renaissance_love
"Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove,",renaissance_love
"And scorning say, See what it is to love.",renaissance_love
"Alas, have I not pain enough, my friend,",renaissance_love
Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire,renaissance_love
"Than did on him who first stale down the fire,",renaissance_love
"While Love on me doth all his quiver spend,",renaissance_love
But with your rhubarb words you must contend,renaissance_love
"To grieve me worse, in saying that Desire",renaissance_love
Doth plunge my well-formed soul even in the mire,renaissance_love
"Of sinful thoughts, which do in ruin end?",renaissance_love
"If that be sin which doth the manners frame,",renaissance_love
"Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed,",renaissance_love
"Ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame;",renaissance_love
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed,renaissance_love
"A loathing of all loose unchastity,",renaissance_love
"Then love is sin, and let me sinful be.",renaissance_love
"Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot,",renaissance_love
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:,renaissance_love
"   But known worth did in mine of time proceed,",renaissance_love
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.,renaissance_love
"I saw, and liked; I liked, but loved not;",renaissance_love
"   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:",renaissance_love
"   At length to loves decrees I, forced, agreed,",renaissance_love
Yet with repining at so partial lot.,renaissance_love
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty,renaissance_love
"Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite",renaissance_love
I call it praise to suffer tyranny;,renaissance_love
And now employ the remnant of my wit,renaissance_love
"   To make myself believe that all is well,",renaissance_love
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.,renaissance_love
   Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame,renaissance_love
"My young mind marred, whom Love doth windlass so,",renaissance_love
That mine own writings like bad servants show,renaissance_love
"My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame,",renaissance_love
"That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame",renaissance_love
"Such coltish gyres, that to my birth I owe",renaissance_love
"Nobler desires, least else that friendly foe,",renaissance_love
"Great expectation, wear a train of shame.",renaissance_love
"For since mad March great promise made of me,",renaissance_love
"If now the May of my years much decline,",renaissance_love
What can be hoped my harvest time will be?,renaissance_love
"Sure you say well, your wisdoms golden mine",renaissance_love
"Dig deep with learnings spade, now tell me this,",renaissance_love
Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is?,renaissance_love
The wisest scholar of the wight most wise,renaissance_love
"By Phoebus doom, with sugared sentence says",renaissance_love
"That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes,",renaissance_love
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise;,renaissance_love
"But, for that man with pain this truth descries,",renaissance_love
"While he each thing in senses balance weighs,",renaissance_love
And so nor will nor can behold those skies,renaissance_love
"Which inward sun to heroic mind displays,",renaissance_love
"Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir",renaissance_love
"Love of herself, takes Stellas shape, that she",renaissance_love
To mortal eyes might sweetly shine in her.,renaissance_love
"It is most true, for since I her did see,",renaissance_love
"Virtues great beauty in that face I prove,",renaissance_love
"And find theffect, for I do burn in love.",renaissance_love
"With how sad steps, O moon, thou climbst the skies!",renaissance_love
"How silently, and with how wan a face!",renaissance_love
What! may it be that even in heavenly place,renaissance_love
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feelst a lovers case:",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace,renaissance_love
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance_love
"Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance_love
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love
"Do they above love to be loved, and yet",renaissance_love
    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
    Do they call virtue thereungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"    What, have I thus betrayed my liberty?",renaissance_love
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave,renaissance_love
"In my free side? or am I born a slave,",renaissance_love
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny?,renaissance_love
Or want I sense to feel my misery?,renaissance_love
"Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have?",renaissance_love
"Who for long faith, though daily help I crave,",renaissance_love
May get no alms but scorn of beggary.,renaissance_love
"Virtue, awake! Beauty but beauty is;",renaissance_love
"I may, I must, I can, I will, I do",renaissance_love
Leave following that which it is gain to miss.,renaissance_love
"Let her go. Soft, but here she comes. Go to,",renaissance_love
"Unkind, I love you not! O me, that eye",renaissance_love
Doth make my heart give to my tongue the lie!,renaissance_love
"Souls joy, bend not those morning stars from me,",renaissance_love
"Where virtue is made strong by beautys might,",renaissance_love
"Where love is chasteness, pain doth learn delight,",renaissance_love
And humbleness grows one with majesty.,renaissance_love
"Whatever may ensue, O let me be",renaissance_love
Co-partner of the riches of that sight;,renaissance_love
Let not mine eyes be hell-drivn from that light;,renaissance_love
"O look, O shine, O let me die and see.",renaissance_love
"For though I oft my self of them bemoan,",renaissance_love
"That through my heart their beamy darts be gone,",renaissance_love
"Whose cureless wounds even now most freshly bleed,",renaissance_love
"Yet since my death wound is already got,",renaissance_love
"Dear killer, spare not they sweet cruel shot;",renaissance_love
A kind of grace it is to slay with speed.,renaissance_love
"I on my horse, and Love on me, doth try",renaissance_love
"Our horsemanships, while by strange work I prove",renaissance_love
"A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love,",renaissance_love
"And now mans wrongs in me, poor beast, descry.",renaissance_love
The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie,renaissance_love
"Are humbled thoughts, which bit of reverence move,",renaissance_love
"Curbed in with fear, but with gilt boss above",renaissance_love
"Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye.",renaissance_love
"The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art,",renaissance_love
Girt fast by memory; and while I spur,renaissance_love
"My horse, he spurs with sharp desire to my heart;",renaissance_love
"He sits me fast, however I do stir;",renaissance_love
And now hath made me to his hand so right,renaissance_love
That in the manage myself takes delight.,renaissance_love
"It is most true, that eyes are formed to serve",renaissance_love
The inward light; and that the heavenly part,renaissance_love

"Rebels to Nature, strive for their own smart.",renaissance_love
"    It is most true, what we call Cupids dart,",renaissance_love

"And, fools, adore in temple of our heart,",renaissance_love
Till that good god make Church and churchman starve.,renaissance_love
"    True, that true beauty virtue is indeed,",renaissance_love
"Whereof this beauty can be but a shade,",renaissance_love
Which elements with mortal mixture breed;,renaissance_love
"True, that on earth we are but pilgrims made,",renaissance_love
    And should in soul up to our country move;,renaissance_love
"True; and yet true, that I must Stella love.",renaissance_love
"A strife is grown between Virtue and Love,",renaissance_love
While each pretends that Stella must be his:,renaissance_love
"Her eyes, her lips, her all, saith Love, do this,",renaissance_love
"Since they do wear his badge, most firmly prove.",renaissance_love
"But Virtue thus that title doth disprove,",renaissance_love
That Stella (O dear name) that Stella is,renaissance_love
"That virtuous soul, sure heir of heavnly bliss;",renaissance_love
"Not this fair outside, which our hearts doth move.",renaissance_love
"And therefore, though her beauty and her grace",renaissance_love
"Be Loves indeed, in Stellas self he may",renaissance_love
By no pretense claim any manner place.,renaissance_love
"Well, Love, since this demur our suit doth stay,",renaissance_love
"Let Virtue have that Stella's self; yet thus,",renaissance_love
Let Virtue but that body grant to us.,renaissance_love
"O Grammar rules, O now your virtues show;",renaissance_love
"    So children still read you with awful eyes,",renaissance_love
    As my young Dove may in your precepts wise,renaissance_love
"Her grant to me, by her own virtue know.",renaissance_love
"For late with heart most high, with eyes most low,",renaissance_love
    I cravd the thing which ever she denies:,renaissance_love

"Least once should not be heard, twice said, No, No.",renaissance_love
"    Sing then my Muse, now Io Pan sing,",renaissance_love
    Heavns envy not at my high triumphing:,renaissance_love
"But Grammars force with sweet success confirm,",renaissance_love
"    For Grammar says (O this dear Stella weigh,)",renaissance_love
    For Grammar says (to Grammar who says nay),renaissance_love
That in one speech two Negatives affirm.,renaissance_love
"Desire, though thou my old companion art,",renaissance_love
And oft so clings to my pure Love that I,renaissance_love
"One from the other scarcely can descry,",renaissance_love
"While each doth blow the fire of my heart,",renaissance_love
Now from thy fellowship I needs must part;,renaissance_love
Venus is taught with Dians wings to fly;,renaissance_love
I must no more in thy sweet passions lie;,renaissance_love
Virtues gold now must head my Cupids dart.,renaissance_love
"Service and honor, wonder with delight,",renaissance_love
"Fear to offend, will worthy to appear,",renaissance_love
"Care shining in mine eyes, faith in my sprite:",renaissance_love
These things are let me by my only dear;,renaissance_love
"But thou, Desire, because thou wouldst have all,",renaissance_love
Now banished art.,renaissance_love
"But yet alas how shall?Stella, think not that I by verse seek fame,",renaissance_love

"Thine eyes my pride, thy lips my history;",renaissance_love
"If thou praise not, all other praise is shame.",renaissance_love
"Nor so ambitious am I, as to frame",renaissance_love
A nest for my young praise in laurel tree:,renaissance_love
"In truth I sweare, I wish not there should be",renaissance_love
Graved in mine epitaph a Poets name:,renaissance_love
"Nay if I would, could I just title make,",renaissance_love
"That any laud to me thereof should grow,",renaissance_love
Without my plumes from others wings I take.,renaissance_love
"For nothing from my wit or will doth flow,",renaissance_love
"Since all my words thy beauty doth endite,",renaissance_love
"And love doth hold my hand, and makes me write.",renaissance_love
"O come, soft rest of cares! come, Night!",renaissance_love
"       Come, naked Virtues only tire,",renaissance_love
The reaped harvest of the light,renaissance_love
"    Bound up in sheaves of sacred fire,",renaissance_love
       Love calls to war:,renaissance_love
"             Sighs his alarms,",renaissance_love

    On glorious Days outfacing face;,renaissance_love
And all thy crowned flames command,renaissance_love
    For torches to our nuptial grace.,renaissance_love

"       Lips his swords are,",renaissance_love
             The field his arms.,renaissance_love
             There is a garden in her face,renaissance_love
   Where roses and white lilies blow;,renaissance_love
"A heavenly paradise is that place,",renaissance_love
   Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow:,renaissance_love
      There cherries grow which none may buy,renaissance_love
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.,renaissance_love
Those cherries fairly do enclose,renaissance_love
"   Of orient pearl a double row,",renaissance_love
"Which when her lovely laughter shows,",renaissance_love
   They look like rose-buds filled with snow;,renaissance_love
      Yet them no peer nor prince can buy,renaissance_love
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.,renaissance_love
Her eyes like angels watch them still;,renaissance_love
"   Her brows like bended bows do stand,",renaissance_love
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill,renaissance_love
   All that attempt with eye or hand,renaissance_love
"      Those sacred cherries to come nigh,",renaissance_love
      Till Cherry-ripe themselves do cry.,renaissance_love
"      The time is come, I must depart",renaissance_love
"   from thee, ah famous city;",renaissance_love
"I never yet to rue my smart,",renaissance_love
   did find that thou hadst pity.,renaissance_love
"Wherefore small cause there is, that I",renaissance_love
   should grieve from thee to go;,renaissance_love
"But many women foolishly,",renaissance_love
"   like me, and other moe,",renaissance_love
"Do such a fixed fancy set,",renaissance_love
"   on those which least deserve,",renaissance_love
That long it is ere wit we get   ,renaissance_love
   away from them to swerve.,renaissance_love
But time with pity oft will tell   ,renaissance_love
"   to those that will her try,",renaissance_love
"Whether it best be more to mell,",renaissance_love
   or utterly defy.,renaissance_love
And now hath time me put in mind,renaissance_love
"   of thy great cruelness,",renaissance_love
"That never once a help would find,",renaissance_love
   to ease me in distress.,renaissance_love
Thou never yet wouldst credit give,renaissance_love
   to board me for a year;,renaissance_love
"Nor with apparel me relieve,",renaissance_love
   except thou payed were.,renaissance_love
"No, no, thou never didst me good,",renaissance_love
"   nor ever wilt, I know.",renaissance_love
"Yet am I in no angry mood,",renaissance_love
"   but will, or ere I go,",renaissance_love
"In perfect love and charity,",renaissance_love
"   my testament here write,",renaissance_love
"And leave to thee such treasury,",renaissance_love
   as I in it recite.,renaissance_love
Now stand aside and give me leave,renaissance_love
      to write my latest will;,renaissance_love
And see that none you do deceive,renaissance_love
   of that I leave them till.,renaissance_love
"   O happy dames, that may embrace",renaissance_love
"The fruit of your delight,",renaissance_love
Help to bewail the woeful case,renaissance_love
And eke the heavy plight,renaissance_love

The fortune of my pleasant choice;,renaissance_love
"Good ladies, help to fill my mourning voice.",renaissance_love

He sails that hath in governance,renaissance_love
My life while it will last;,renaissance_love

"Toward me, the sweet port of his avail.",renaissance_love
Alas! how oft in dreams I see,renaissance_love
Those eyes that were my food;,renaissance_love
"Which sometime so delighted me,",renaissance_love
That yet they do me good;,renaissance_love
"Wherewith I wake with his return,",renaissance_love
Whose absent flame did make me burn:,renaissance_love
"But when I find the lack, Lord, how I mourn!",renaissance_love
When other lovers in arms across,renaissance_love
Rejoice their chief delight.,renaissance_love
"Drowned in tears, to mourn my loss",renaissance_love
I stand the bitter night,renaissance_love
"In my window, where I may see",renaissance_love
Before the winds how the clouds flee.,renaissance_love
Lo! what a mariner love hath made of me!,renaissance_love
And in green waves when the salt flood,renaissance_love
"Doth rise by rage of wind,",renaissance_love
A thousand fancies in that mood,renaissance_love
Assail my restless mind.,renaissance_love
"Alas! now drencheth my sweet foe,",renaissance_love
"That with the spoil of my heart did go,",renaissance_love
"And left me; but, alas! why did he so?",renaissance_love
And when the seas wax calm again,renaissance_love
"To chase fro me annoy,",renaissance_love
My doubtful hope doth cause me pain;,renaissance_love
So dread cuts off my joy.,renaissance_love
"Thus is my wealth mingled with woe,",renaissance_love
And of each thought a doubt doth grow;,renaissance_love
"Now he comes! Will he come? Alas, no, no!",renaissance_love
 Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty,renaissance_love
"Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal:",renaissance_love
"Returning thee the tribute of my duty,",renaissance_love
"Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal.",renaissance_love
"Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul,",renaissance_love
Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care:,renaissance_love
"Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll",renaissance_love
How they were spent for thee; look what they are.,renaissance_love

All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.,renaissance_love
"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,",renaissance_love
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;,renaissance_love
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest,renaissance_love
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.,renaissance_love
"I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,",renaissance_love
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;,renaissance_love
And yet love knows it is a greater grief,renaissance_love
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.,renaissance_love
"    Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,",renaissance_love
"    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.",renaissance_love
    Not marble nor the gilded monuments,renaissance_love
"Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,",renaissance_love
But you shall shine more bright in these contents,renaissance_love
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.,renaissance_love
"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,",renaissance_love
"And broils root out the work of masonry,",renaissance_love
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn,renaissance_love
The living record of your memory.,renaissance_love
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity,renaissance_love
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,renaissance_love
Even in the eyes of all posterity,renaissance_love
That wear this world out to the ending doom.,renaissance_love
"    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,",renaissance_love
"    You live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes.",renaissance_love
"    Being your slave, what should I do but tend",renaissance_love
Upon the hours and times of your desire?,renaissance_love
"I have no precious time at all to spend,",renaissance_love
"Nor services to do, till you require.",renaissance_love
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,renaissance_love
"Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.",renaissance_love
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,renaissance_love
When you have bid your servant once adieu;,renaissance_love
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,renaissance_love
"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,",renaissance_love
"But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,",renaissance_love
"Save, where you are how happy you make those.",renaissance_love
So true a fool is love that in your will,renaissance_love
"Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",renaissance_love
"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea",renaissance_love
"But sad mortality oer-sways their power,",renaissance_love
"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,",renaissance_love
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?,renaissance_love
"O, how shall summers honey breath hold out",renaissance_love
"Against the wrackful siege of battring days,",renaissance_love
"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,",renaissance_love
"Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?",renaissance_love
"O fearful meditation! where, alack,",renaissance_love
Shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid?,renaissance_love
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?,renaissance_love
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?,renaissance_love
"   O, none, unless this miracle have might,",renaissance_love
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.,renaissance_love
"   Why is my verse so barren of new pride,",renaissance_love
So far from variation or quick change?,renaissance_love
Why with the time do I not glance aside,renaissance_love
"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?",renaissance_love
"Why write I still all one, ever the same,",renaissance_love
"And keep invention in a noted weed,",renaissance_love
"That every word doth almost tell my name,",renaissance_love
"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?",renaissance_love
"O know, sweet love, I always write of you,",renaissance_love
"And you and love are still my argument,",renaissance_love
"So all my best is dressing old words new,",renaissance_love
Spending again what is already spent:,renaissance_love
"   For as the sun is daily new and old,",renaissance_love
   So is my love still telling what is told.,renaissance_love
"   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,",renaissance_love
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.,renaissance_love
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;,renaissance_love
My bonds in thee are all determinate.,renaissance_love
"For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,",renaissance_love
And for that riches where is my deserving?,renaissance_love
"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,",renaissance_love
And so my patent back again is swerving.,renaissance_love
"Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,",renaissance_love
"Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,",renaissance_love
"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,",renaissance_love
"Comes home again, on better judgement making.",renaissance_love
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:,renaissance_love
"   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.",renaissance_love
"   From you have I been absent in the spring,",renaissance_love
"When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,",renaissance_love
"Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,",renaissance_love
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.,renaissance_love
"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell",renaissance_love
"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,",renaissance_love
"Could make me any summers story tell,",renaissance_love
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:,renaissance_love
"Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,",renaissance_love
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;,renaissance_love
"They were but sweet, but figures of delight",renaissance_love
"Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.",renaissance_love
"    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,",renaissance_love
    As with your shadow I with these did play.,renaissance_love
"    To me, fair friend, you never can be old,",renaissance_love
"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,",renaissance_love
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,renaissance_love
"Have from the forests shook three summers pride,",renaissance_love
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,renaissance_love
"In process of the seasons have I seen,",renaissance_love
"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,",renaissance_love
"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.",renaissance_love
"Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,",renaissance_love
"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;",renaissance_love
"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,",renaissance_love
"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:",renaissance_love
"For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:",renaissance_love
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead.,renaissance_love
"O! never say that I was false of heart,",renaissance_love
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.,renaissance_love
As easy might I from myself depart,renaissance_love
"As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:",renaissance_love
"That is my home of love; if I have ranged,",renaissance_love
"Like him that travels, I return again,",renaissance_love
"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,",renaissance_love
So that myself bring water for my stain.,renaissance_love
"Never believe, though in my nature reigned",renaissance_love
"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,",renaissance_love
"That it could so preposterously be stained,",renaissance_love
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;,renaissance_love
"   For nothing this wide universe I call,",renaissance_love
"   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.",renaissance_love
"   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr",renaissance_love
"Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,",renaissance_love
"Who hast by waning grown, and therein showst",renaissance_love
"Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst",renaissance_love
"In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,",renaissance_love
"As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,",renaissance_love
"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill",renaissance_love
"May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.",renaissance_love
"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;",renaissance_love
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.,renaissance_love
"   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,",renaissance_love
   And her quietus is to render thee.,renaissance_love
"   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,",renaissance_love
"And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;",renaissance_love
"More than enough am I that vex thee still,",renaissance_love
To thy sweet will making addition thus.,renaissance_love
"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,",renaissance_love
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?,renaissance_love
"Shall will in others seem right gracious,",renaissance_love
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?,renaissance_love
"The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,",renaissance_love
And in abundance addeth to his store;,renaissance_love
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will,renaissance_love
"One will of mine, to make thy large Will more.",renaissance_love
"   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;",renaissance_love
"   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.",renaissance_love
"   When my love swears that she is made of truth,",renaissance_love
"I do believe her, though I know she lies,",renaissance_love
"That she might think me some untutored youth,",renaissance_love
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.,renaissance_love
"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,",renaissance_love
"Although she knows my days are past the best,",renaissance_love
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:,renaissance_love
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.,renaissance_love
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?,renaissance_love
And wherefore say not I that I am old?,renaissance_love
"Oh, loves best habit is in seeming trust,",renaissance_love
And age in love loves not to have years told.,renaissance_love
"    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,",renaissance_love
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.,renaissance_love
"    In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",renaissance_love
For they in thee a thousand errors note;,renaissance_love
"But tis my heart that loves what they despise,",renaissance_love
"Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",renaissance_love
"Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,",renaissance_love
"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",renaissance_love
"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",renaissance_love
To any sensual feast with thee alone:,renaissance_love
But my five wits nor my five senses can,renaissance_love
"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",renaissance_love
"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",renaissance_love
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.,renaissance_love
"   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",renaissance_love
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.,renaissance_love
"   Two loves I have of comfort and despair,",renaissance_love
Which like two spirits do suggest me still,renaissance_love
"The better angel is a man right fair,",renaissance_love
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.,renaissance_love
"To win me soon to hell, my female evil",renaissance_love
"Tempteth my better angel from my side,",renaissance_love
"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,",renaissance_love
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.,renaissance_love
"And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,",renaissance_love
"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,",renaissance_love
"But being both from me both to each friend,",renaissance_love
I guess one angel in anothers hell.,renaissance_love
"   Yet this shall I neer know, but live in doubt,",renaissance_love
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.,renaissance_love
"   I that have been a lover, and could show it,",renaissance_love
"Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,",renaissance_love
"Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become",renaissance_love
"A better lover, and much better poet.",renaissance_love
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it,renaissance_love
"To those true numerous graces, whereof some",renaissance_love
"But charm the senses, others overcome",renaissance_love
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:,renaissance_love
"For in your verse all Cupids armory,",renaissance_love
"His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,",renaissance_love
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.,renaissance_love
"But then his mothers sweets you so apply,",renaissance_love
"Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take",renaissance_love
For Venus ceston every line you make.,renaissance_love
"Take, oh, take those lips away",renaissance_love
That so sweetly were forsworn,renaissance_love
"And those eyes, like break of day,",renaissance_love
Lights that do mislead the morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, though sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,",renaissance_love
"Which thy frozen bosom bears,",renaissance_love
On whose tops the pinks that grow,renaissance_love
Are of those that April wears;,renaissance_love
"But first set my poor heart free,",renaissance_love
Bound in those icy chains by thee.,renaissance_love
"Though I am young, and cannot tell",renaissance_love
"    Either what Death or Love is well,",renaissance_love
"Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",renaissance_love
    And both do aim at human hearts.,renaissance_love
"And then again, I have been told",renaissance_love
"    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",renaissance_love
So that I fear they do but bring,renaissance_love
"    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",renaissance_love
As in a ruin we it call,renaissance_love
"    One thing to be blown up, or fall;",renaissance_love
Or to our end like way may have,renaissance_love
"    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",renaissance_love
So Loves inflamed shaft or brand,renaissance_love
    May kill as soon as Deaths cold hand;,renaissance_love
Except Loves fires the virtue have,renaissance_love
    To fright the frost out of the grave.,renaissance_love
"    Though that men do call it dotage,",renaissance_love
Who loveth not wanteth courage;,renaissance_love
"And whosoever may love get,",renaissance_love
From Venus sure he must it fet,renaissance_love
"Or else from her which is her heir,",renaissance_love
And she to him must seem most fair.,renaissance_love
With eye and mind doth both agree.,renaissance_love
There is no boot: there must it be.,renaissance_love
"The eye doth look and represent,",renaissance_love
But mind afformeth with full consent.,renaissance_love
Thus am I fixed without grudge:,renaissance_love
Mine eye with heart doth me so judge.,renaissance_love
Love maintaineth all noble courage.,renaissance_love
Who love disdaineth is all of the village:,renaissance_love
Such loversthough they take pain,renaissance_love
"It were pity they should obtain,",renaissance_love
For often times where they do sue,renaissance_love
They hinder lovers that would be true.,renaissance_love
For whoso loveth should love but once.,renaissance_love
"Change whoso will, I will be none.",renaissance_love
"Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,",renaissance_love
"Until I labour, I in labour lie.",renaissance_love
"The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,",renaissance_love
Is tird with standing though he never fight.,renaissance_love
"Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,",renaissance_love
But a far fairer world encompassing.,renaissance_love
"Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,",renaissance_love
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.,renaissance_love
"Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,",renaissance_love
"Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.",renaissance_love
"Off with that happy busk, which I envy,",renaissance_love
"That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.",renaissance_love
"Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,",renaissance_love
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.,renaissance_love
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew,renaissance_love
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:,renaissance_love
"Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread",renaissance_love
"In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.",renaissance_love
"In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be",renaissance_love
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee,renaissance_love
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though,renaissance_love
"Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,",renaissance_love
"By this these Angels from an evil sprite,",renaissance_love
"Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.",renaissance_love
"    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,",renaissance_love
"Before, behind, between, above, below.",renaissance_love
"O my America! my new-found-land,",renaissance_love
"My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mannd,",renaissance_love
"My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,",renaissance_love
How blest am I in this discovering thee!,renaissance_love
"To enter in these bonds, is to be free;",renaissance_love
"Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.",renaissance_love
"    Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,",renaissance_love
"As souls unbodied, bodies unclothd must be,",renaissance_love
To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use,renaissance_love
"Are like Atlantas balls, cast in mens views,",renaissance_love
"That when a fools eye lighteth on a Gem,",renaissance_love
"His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.",renaissance_love
"Like pictures, or like books gay coverings made",renaissance_love
"For lay-men, are all women thus arrayd;",renaissance_love
"Themselves are mystic books, which only we",renaissance_love
(Whom their imputed grace will dignify),renaissance_love
Must see reveald. Then since that I may know;,renaissance_love
"As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew",renaissance_love
"Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,",renaissance_love
There is no penance due to innocence.,renaissance_love
"    To teach thee, I am naked first; why then",renaissance_love
What needst thou have more covering than a man.,renaissance_love
"Merry Margaret,",renaissance_love
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as a falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower:,renaissance_love
"With solace and gladness,",renaissance_love
"Much mirth and no madness,",renaissance_love
All good and no badness;,renaissance_love
"So joyously,",renaissance_love
"So maidenly,",renaissance_love
So womanly,renaissance_love
Her demeaning,renaissance_love
"In every thing,",renaissance_love
"Far, far passing",renaissance_love
"That I can indite,",renaissance_love
Or suffice to write,renaissance_love
Of Merry Margaret,renaissance_love
"As midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance_love
As patient and still,renaissance_love
And as full of good will,renaissance_love
"As fair Isaphill,",renaissance_love
"Coriander,",renaissance_love
"Sweet pomander,",renaissance_love
"Good Cassander,",renaissance_love
"Steadfast of thought,",renaissance_love
"Well made, well wrought,",renaissance_love
Far may be sought,renaissance_love
Ere that ye can find,renaissance_love
"So courteous, so kind",renaissance_love
"As Merry Margaret,",renaissance_love
"This midsummer flower,",renaissance_love
Gentle as falcon,renaissance_love
Or hawk of the tower.,renaissance_love
That neither fame nor love might wanting be,renaissance_love
"To greatness, Cary, I sing that and thee;",renaissance_love
"Whose house, if it no other honor had,",renaissance_love
In only thee might be both great and glad;,renaissance_love
"Who, to upbraid the sloth of this our time,",renaissance_love
"Durst valor make almost, but not, a crime;",renaissance_love
"Which deed I know not, whether were more high,",renaissance_love
"Or thou more happy, it to justify",renaissance_love
"Against thy fortune: when no foe, that day,",renaissance_love
"Could conquer thee but chance, who did betray.",renaissance_love
"Love thy great loss, which a renown hath won,",renaissance_love
"To live when Broick not stands, nor Ruhr doth run.",renaissance_love
"Love honors, which of best example be",renaissance_love
When they cost dearest and are done most free;,renaissance_love
"Though every fortitude deserves applause,",renaissance_love
It may be much or little in the cause.,renaissance_love
"Hes valiantst that dares fight, and not for pay;",renaissance_love
"That virtuous is, when the rewards away.",renaissance_love
"Methought I saw the grave where Laura lay,",renaissance_love
Within that temple where the vestal flame,renaissance_love
"Was wont to burn; and, passing by that way,",renaissance_love
"To see that buried dust of living fame,",renaissance_love
"Whose tomb fair Love, and fairer Virtue kept:",renaissance_love
All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;,renaissance_love
"At whose approach the soul of Petrarch wept,",renaissance_love
"And, from thenceforth, those Graces were not seen:",renaissance_love
For they this queen attended; in whose stead,renaissance_love
Oblivion laid him down on Lauras hearse:,renaissance_love
"Hereat the hardest stones were seen to bleed,",renaissance_love
And groans of buried ghosts the heavens did pierce:,renaissance_love
"Where Homers spright did tremble all for grief,",renaissance_love
And cursed the access of that celestial thief!,renaissance_love
"When thou must home to shades of underground,",renaissance_love
"And there arrived, a new admired guest,",renaissance_love
"The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,",renaissance_love
"White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,",renaissance_love
To hear the stories of thy finished love,renaissance_love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;,renaissance_love
"Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,",renaissance_love
"Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,",renaissance_love
"Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,",renaissance_love
And all these triumphs for thy beautys sake:,renaissance_love
"When thou hast told these honours done to thee,",renaissance_love
"Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me!",renaissance_love
As you came from the holy land,renaissance_love
of Walsinghame,renaissance_love
Met you not with my true love,renaissance_love
By the way as you came?,renaissance_love
How shall I know your true love,renaissance_love
That have met many one,renaissance_love
As I went to the holy land,renaissance_love
"That have come, that have gone?",renaissance_love
She is neither white nor brown,renaissance_love
But as the heavens fair,renaissance_love
There is none hath a form so divine,renaissance_love
In the earth or the air.,renaissance_love
"Such an one did I meet, good Sir,",renaissance_love
"Such an Angelic face,",renaissance_love
"Who like a queen, like a nymph, did appear",renaissance_love
"By her gait, by her grace.",renaissance_love
"She hath left me here all alone,",renaissance_love
"All alone as unknown,",renaissance_love
"Who sometimes did me lead with her self,",renaissance_love
And me loved as her own.,renaissance_love
Whats the cause that she leaves you alone,renaissance_love
And a new way doth take;,renaissance_love
Who loved you once as her own,renaissance_love
And her joy did you make?,renaissance_love
"I have loved her all my youth,",renaissance_love
"But now old, as you see,",renaissance_love
Love likes not the falling fruit,renaissance_love
From the withered tree.,renaissance_love
Know that love is a careless child,renaissance_love
"And forgets promise past,",renaissance_love
"He is blind, he is deaf when he list",renaissance_love
And in faith never fast.,renaissance_love
His desire is a dureless content,renaissance_love
And a trustless joy,renaissance_love
He is won with a world of despair,renaissance_love
And is lost with a toy.,renaissance_love
Of womenkind such indeed is the love,renaissance_love
Or the word Love abused,renaissance_love
Under which many childish desires,renaissance_love
And conceits are excused.,renaissance_love
But true Love is a durable fire,renaissance_love
In the mind ever burning;,renaissance_love
"Never sick, never old, never dead,",renaissance_love
From itself never turning.,renaissance_love
"What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show,",renaissance_love
"Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know?",renaissance_love
"Thus shrewdly burden, then, how can my Muse escape?",renaissance_love
"The gods must help, and precious things must serve to show her shape.",renaissance_love
"Like great god Saturn, fair, and like fair Venus, chaste;",renaissance_love
"As smooth as Pan, as Juno mild, like goddess Iris fast.",renaissance_love
"With Cupid she foresees, and goes god Vulcans pace;",renaissance_love
"And for a taste of all these gifts, she borrows Momus grace.",renaissance_love
"Her forehead jacinth-like, her cheeks of opal hue,",renaissance_love
"Her twinkling eyes bedecked with pearl, her lips of sapphire blue,",renaissance_love
"Her hair pure crapall stone, her mouth, O heavenly wide,",renaissance_love
"Her skin like burnished gold, her hands like silver ore untried.",renaissance_love
"As for those parts unknown, which hidden sure are best,",renaissance_love
"Happy be they which believe, and never seek the rest.",renaissance_love
"When I was fair and young, then favor graced me.",renaissance_love
Of many was I sought their mistress for to be.,renaissance_love
But I did scorn them all and answered them therefore:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,",renaissance_love
"How many sighing hearts I have not skill to show,",renaissance_love
But I the prouder grew and still this spake therefore:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"Then spake fair Venus son, that proud victorious boy,",renaissance_love
"Saying: You dainty dame, for that you be so coy,",renaissance_love
I will so pluck your plumes as you shall say no more:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"As soon as he had said, such change grew in my breast",renaissance_love
That neither night nor day I could take any rest.,renaissance_love
Wherefore I did repent that I had said before:,renaissance_love
"Go, go, go, seek some other where, importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"When to her lute Corinna sings,",renaissance_love
"Her voice revives the leaden strings,",renaissance_love
And doth in highest notes appear,renaissance_love
As any challenged echo clear;,renaissance_love
"But when she doth of mourning speak,",renaissance_love
Evn with her sighs the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"And as her lute doth live or die,",renaissance_love
"Let by her passion, so must I:",renaissance_love
"For when of pleasure she doth sing,",renaissance_love
"My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,",renaissance_love
"But if she doth of sorrow speak,",renaissance_love
Evn from my heart the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"Now thou has loved me one whole day,",renaissance_love
"Tomorrow when you leavst, what wilt thou say?",renaissance_love
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?,renaissance_love
            Or say that now,renaissance_love
We are not just those persons which we were?,renaissance_love
"Or, that oaths made in reverential fear",renaissance_love
"Of Love, and his wrath, any may forswear?",renaissance_love
"Or, as true deaths true marriages untie,",renaissance_love
"So lovers contracts, images of those,",renaissance_love
"Bind but till sleep, deaths image, them unloose?",renaissance_love
"            Or, your own end to justify,",renaissance_love
"For having purposed change and falsehood, you",renaissance_love
Can have no way but falsehood to be true?,renaissance_love
"Vain lunatic, against these scapes I could",renaissance_love
"            Dispute and conquer, if I would,",renaissance_love
"            Which I abstain to do,",renaissance_love
"For by tomorrow, I may think so too.",renaissance_love
"Womanhood, wanton, ye want:",renaissance_love
"Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;",renaissance_love
"Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,",renaissance_love
"Ye rail at riot, reckless:",renaissance_love
To praise your port it is needless;,renaissance_love
"For all your draff yet and your dregs,",renaissance_love
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.,renaissance_love
Why so coy and full of scorn?,renaissance_love
"Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;",renaissance_love

Of your door-gate ye have no doubt:,renaissance_love
"But one thing is, that ye be lewd:",renaissance_love
"Hold your tongue now, all beshrewd!",renaissance_love
"To mistress Anne, that farly sweet,",renaissance_love
That wones at The Key in Thames Street.,renaissance_love
" Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest;",renaissance_love
"Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,",renaissance_love
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;,renaissance_love
Such profit he of envy could obtain.,renaissance_love
"A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,",renaissance_love
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain,renaissance_love
"As on a stith, where some work of fame",renaissance_love
"Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.",renaissance_love
"A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,",renaissance_love
"Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;",renaissance_love
"Amid great storms whom grace assured so,",renaissance_love
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.,renaissance_love
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;,renaissance_love
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;,renaissance_love
"A mark the which (unperfited, for time)",renaissance_love
"Some may approach, but never none shall hit.",renaissance_love

"Our English youth, by travail unto fame.",renaissance_love
"An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,",renaissance_love
"Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;",renaissance_love
Whose piercing look did represent a mind,renaissance_love
"With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.",renaissance_love
A heart where dread yet never so impressed,renaissance_love
To hide the thought that might the truth avaunce;,renaissance_love
"In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,",renaissance_love
"To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.",renaissance_love

"         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,",renaissance_love
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.,renaissance_love

         More subtle than the parent is,renaissance_love
"Love must not be, but take a body too;",renaissance_love

"That it assume thy body, I allow,",renaissance_love
"And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.",renaissance_love
"Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,",renaissance_love
"And so more steadily to have gone,",renaissance_love
"With wares which would sink admiration,",renaissance_love
I saw I had love's pinnace overfraught;,renaissance_love
         Ev'ry thy hair for love to work upon,renaissance_love

"         For, nor in nothing, nor in things",renaissance_love

Base thing I can no more endure to view;,renaissance_love
"But looking still on her, I stand amazed",renaissance_love
At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.,renaissance_love
"So when my tongue would speak her praises due,",renaissance_love
It stopped is with thought's astonishment:,renaissance_love
"And when my pen would write her titles true,",renaissance_love
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:,renaissance_love
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write,renaissance_love
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.,renaissance_love
"ike as a huntsman after weary chase,",renaissance_love
"Seeing the game from him escap'd away,",renaissance_love
"Sits down to rest him in some shady place,",renaissance_love
With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:,renaissance_love
"So after long pursuit and vain assay,",renaissance_love

Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.,renaissance_love
"There she beholding me with milder look,",renaissance_love
"Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:",renaissance_love
"Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,",renaissance_love
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.,renaissance_love
"Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,",renaissance_love
"So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",renaissance_love
"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,",renaissance_love
With which that happy name was first design'd:,renaissance_love

That honour and large richesse to me lent.,renaissance_love

By whom my spirit out of dust was raised:,renaissance_love
"To speak her praise and glory excellent,",renaissance_love
Of all alive most worthy to be praised.,renaissance_love
"Ye three Elizabeths for ever live,",renaissance_love
That three such graces did unto me give.,renaissance_love
"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,",renaissance_love
For that your self ye daily such do see:,renaissance_love
"But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,",renaissance_love
"And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.",renaissance_love
"For all the rest, how ever fair it be,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:,renaissance_love
But only that is permanent and free,renaissance_love
"From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.",renaissance_love
That is true beauty: that doth argue you,renaissance_love
"To be divine, and born of heavenly seed:",renaissance_love
"Deriv'd from that fair Spirit, from whom all true",renaissance_love
And perfect beauty did at first proceed.,renaissance_love
"He only fair, and what he fair hath made,",renaissance_love
"All other fair, like flowers untimely fade.",renaissance_love
"One day I wrote her name upon the strand,",renaissance_love
But came the waves and washed it away:,renaissance_love

"Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire,",renaissance_love
"Thou in me kindlest much more great desire,",renaissance_love
And up aloft above my strength dost raise,renaissance_love
The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.,renaissance_love
"That as I erst in praise of thine own name,",renaissance_love
"So now in honour of thy mother dear,",renaissance_love
"An honourable hymn I eke should frame,",renaissance_love
"And with the brightness of her beauty clear,",renaissance_love
The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear,renaissance_love
"To admiration of that heavenly light,",renaissance_love
From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.,renaissance_love
"Thereto do thou, great goddess, queen of beauty,",renaissance_love
"Mother of love, and of all world's delight,",renaissance_love
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty,renaissance_love
"Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight,",renaissance_love
Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light,renaissance_love
"T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,",renaissance_love
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:,renaissance_love
"That both to thee, to whom I mean it most,",renaissance_love
"And eke to her, whose fair immortal beam",renaissance_love
"Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,",renaissance_love
"That now it wasted is with woes extreme,",renaissance_love
"It may so please, that she at length will stream",renaissance_love
"Some dew of grace into my withered heart,",renaissance_love
After long sorrow and consuming smart.,renaissance_love
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast,renaissance_love
"To make all things such as we now behold,",renaissance_love
It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd,renaissance_love
"A goodly pattern, to whose perfect mould",renaissance_love
He fashion'd them as comely as he could;,renaissance_love
"That now so fair and seemly they appear,",renaissance_love
As nought may be amended anywhere.,renaissance_love
"That wondrous pattern, wheresoe'er it be,",renaissance_love
"Whether in earth laid up in secret store,",renaissance_love
"Or else in heaven, that no man may it see",renaissance_love
"With sinful eyes, for fear it to deflore,",renaissance_love
"Is perfect Beauty, which all men adore;",renaissance_love
Whose face and feature doth so much excel,renaissance_love
"All mortal sense, that none the same may tell.",renaissance_love
Thereof as every earthly thing partakes,renaissance_love
"Or more or less, by influence divine,",renaissance_love
"So it more fair accordingly it makes,",renaissance_love
"And the gross matter of this earthly mine,",renaissance_love
"Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,",renaissance_love
Doing away the dross which dims the light,renaissance_love
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.,renaissance_love
"For, through infusion of celestial power,",renaissance_love
"The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,",renaissance_love
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour,renaissance_love
"Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight",renaissance_love
"They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,",renaissance_love
"O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam",renaissance_love
"Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.",renaissance_love
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace,renaissance_love
"To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,",renaissance_love
"Light of thy lamp, which, shining in the face,",renaissance_love
"Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,",renaissance_love
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;,renaissance_love
"Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,",renaissance_love
"That wounds the life, and wastes the inmost marrow.",renaissance_love
"How vainly then do idle wits invent,",renaissance_love
That beauty is nought else but mixture made,renaissance_love
"Of colours fair, and goodly temp'rament",renaissance_love
"Of pure complexions, that shall quickly fade",renaissance_love
"And pass away, like to a summer's shade;",renaissance_love
Or that it is but comely composition,renaissance_love
"Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.",renaissance_love
"Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,",renaissance_love
"That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,",renaissance_love
"And therein stir such rage and restless stour,",renaissance_love
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?,renaissance_love
Or can proportion of the outward part,renaissance_love
"Move such affection in the inward mind,",renaissance_love
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?,renaissance_love
"Why do not then the blossoms of the field,",renaissance_love
"Which are array'd with much more orient hue,",renaissance_love
"And to the sense most dainty odours yield,",renaissance_love
Work like impression in the looker's view?,renaissance_love
"Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,",renaissance_love
In which oft-times we nature see of art,renaissance_love
"Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?",renaissance_love
"But ah, believe me, there is more than so,",renaissance_love
That works such wonders in the minds of men;,renaissance_love
"I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,",renaissance_love
"And whoso list the like assays to ken,",renaissance_love
"Shall find by trial, and confess it then,",renaissance_love
"That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,",renaissance_love
"An outward shew of things, that only seem.",renaissance_love
"For that same goodly hue of white and red,",renaissance_love
"With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,",renaissance_love
"And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread",renaissance_love
"Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away",renaissance_love
"To that they were, even to corrupted clay;",renaissance_love
"That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.,renaissance_love
"But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray",renaissance_love
"That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,",renaissance_love
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;,renaissance_love
"But when the vital spirits do expire,",renaissance_love
Unto her native planet shall retire;,renaissance_love
"For it is heavenly born and cannot die,",renaissance_love
Being a parcel of the purest sky.,renaissance_love
"For when the soul, the which derived was,",renaissance_love
"At first, out of that great immortal Spright,",renaissance_love
"By whom all live to love, whilom did pass",renaissance_love
Down from the top of purest heaven's height,renaissance_love
"To be embodied here, it then took light",renaissance_love
"And lively spirits from that fairest star,",renaissance_love
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.,renaissance_love
"Which power retaining still or more or less,",renaissance_love
"When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,",renaissance_love
"Through every part she doth the same impress,",renaissance_love
"According as the heavens have her graced,",renaissance_love
"And frames her house, in which she will be placed,",renaissance_love
"Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil",renaissance_love
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.,renaissance_love
"Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have",renaissance_love
"The most resemblance of that heavenly light,",renaissance_love
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave,renaissance_love
"Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,",renaissance_love
And the gross matter by a sovereign might,renaissance_love
"Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen",renaissance_love
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.,renaissance_love
"So every spirit, as it is most pure,",renaissance_love
"And hath in it the more of heavenly light,",renaissance_love
So it the fairer body doth procure,renaissance_love
"To habit in, and it more fairly dight",renaissance_love
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.,renaissance_love
For of the soul the body form doth take:,renaissance_love
"For soul is form, and doth the body make.",renaissance_love
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold,renaissance_love
"A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,",renaissance_love
"Know this for certain, that the same doth hold",renaissance_love
"A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,",renaissance_love
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.,renaissance_love
"For all that fair is, is by nature good;",renaissance_love
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.,renaissance_love
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind,renaissance_love
"Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,",renaissance_love
"Either by chance, against the course of kind,",renaissance_love
"Or through unaptness in the substance found,",renaissance_love
"Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,",renaissance_love
"That will not yield unto her form's direction,",renaissance_love
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.,renaissance_love
"And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)",renaissance_love
"That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,",renaissance_love
"Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,",renaissance_love
"Which doth the world with her delight adorn,",renaissance_love
"Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,",renaissance_love
"Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,",renaissance_love
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.,renaissance_love
"Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,",renaissance_love
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:,renaissance_love
"Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame",renaissance_love
"May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:",renaissance_love
"Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,",renaissance_love
"However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;",renaissance_love
For things immortal no corruption take.,renaissance_love
"But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments",renaissance_love
"And lively images of heaven's light,",renaissance_love
Let not your beams with such disparagements,renaissance_love
"Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;",renaissance_love
"But mindful still of your first country's sight,",renaissance_love
"Do still preserve your first informed grace,",renaissance_love
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.,renaissance_love
"Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,",renaissance_love
"Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,",renaissance_love
"That base affections, which your ears would bland,",renaissance_love
"Commend to you by love's abused name,",renaissance_love
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;,renaissance_love
"Which will the garland of your glory mar,",renaissance_love
And quench the light of your bright shining star.,renaissance_love
"But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,",renaissance_love
"Will more illumine your resplendent ray,",renaissance_love
"And add more brightness to your goodly hue,",renaissance_love
"From light of his pure fire; which, by like way",renaissance_love
"Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;",renaissance_love
"Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,",renaissance_love
Do both express the face's first impression.,renaissance_love
"Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,",renaissance_love
"It you behoves to love, and forth to lay",renaissance_love
"That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,",renaissance_love
That men the more admire their fountain may;,renaissance_love
"For else what booteth that celestial ray,",renaissance_love
"If it in darkness be enshrined ever,",renaissance_love
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?,renaissance_love
"But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,",renaissance_love
"That likest to yourselves ye them select,",renaissance_love
"The which your forms' first source may sympathize,",renaissance_love
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;,renaissance_love
"For, if you loosely love without respect,",renaissance_love
"It is no love, but a discordant war,",renaissance_love
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.,renaissance_love
For love is a celestial harmony,renaissance_love
"Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,",renaissance_love
"Which join together in sweet sympathy,",renaissance_love
"To work each other's joy and true content,",renaissance_love
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent,renaissance_love
"Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see",renaissance_love
And know each other here belov'd to be.,renaissance_love
Then wrong it were that any other twain,renaissance_love
Should in love's gentle band combined be,renaissance_love
"But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,",renaissance_love
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;,renaissance_love
"For all that like the beauty which they see,",renaissance_love
Straight do not love; for love is not so light,renaissance_love
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.,renaissance_love
"But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,",renaissance_love
"With pure regard and spotless true intent,",renaissance_love
Drawing out of the object of their eyes,renaissance_love
"A more refined form, which they present",renaissance_love
"Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;",renaissance_love
"Which it reducing to her first perfection,",renaissance_love
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.,renaissance_love
"And then conforming it unto the light,",renaissance_love
"Which in itself it hath remaining still,",renaissance_love
"Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,",renaissance_love
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill,renaissance_love
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;,renaissance_love
"And it embracing in his mind entire,",renaissance_love
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.,renaissance_love
"Which seeing now so inly fair to be,",renaissance_love
"As outward it appeareth to the eye,",renaissance_love
"And with his spirit's proportion to agree,",renaissance_love
"He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,",renaissance_love
And fully setteth his felicity;,renaissance_love
"Counting it fairer than it is indeed,",renaissance_love
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.,renaissance_love
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be,renaissance_love
"Than other men's, and in dear love's delight",renaissance_love
"See more than any other eyes can see,",renaissance_love
"Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,",renaissance_love
"Which carry privy message to the spright,",renaissance_love
"And to their eyes that inmost fair display,",renaissance_love
As plain as light discovers dawning day.,renaissance_love
"Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,",renaissance_love
"Armies of loves still flying to and fro,",renaissance_love
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;,renaissance_love
"Whom having wounded, back again they go,",renaissance_love
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;,renaissance_love
"Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,",renaissance_love
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.,renaissance_love
In which how many wonders do they rede,renaissance_love
"To their conceit, that others never see,",renaissance_love
"Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,",renaissance_love
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;,renaissance_love
"Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;",renaissance_love
"But when her words' embassade forth she sends,",renaissance_love
"Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.",renaissance_love
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold,renaissance_love
A thousand graces masking in delight;,renaissance_love
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold,renaissance_love
"Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight",renaissance_love
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;,renaissance_love
"But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,",renaissance_love
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.,renaissance_love
"All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more",renaissance_love
"Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,",renaissance_love
"To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,",renaissance_love
"That may it more to mortal eyes commend,",renaissance_love
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:,renaissance_love
"That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,",renaissance_love
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.,renaissance_love
"Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,",renaissance_love
"Advance the banner of thy conquest high,",renaissance_love
"That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,",renaissance_love
"May draw to thee, and with due fealty",renaissance_love
"Adore the power of thy great majesty,",renaissance_love
"Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,",renaissance_love
"Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.",renaissance_love
"In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,",renaissance_love
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive,renaissance_love
"My trembling heart in her eternal chain,",renaissance_love
"One drop of grace at length will to me give,",renaissance_love
"That I her bounden thrall by her may live,",renaissance_love
"And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,",renaissance_love
"May owe to her, of whom I it received.",renaissance_love
"And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,",renaissance_love
"Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,",renaissance_love
"When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,",renaissance_love
"Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,",renaissance_love
"That may recure my heart's long pining grief,",renaissance_love
"And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,",renaissance_love
That can restore a damned wight from death.,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay, for shame,",renaissance_love
To save thee from the blame,renaissance_love
Of all my grief and grame;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath loved thee so long,renaissance_love
In wealth and woe among?,renaissance_love
And is thy heart so strong,renaissance_love
As for to leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath given thee my heart,renaissance_love
"Never for to depart,",renaissance_love
Nother for pain nor smart;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus,renaissance_love
And have no more pity,renaissance_love
Of him that loveth thee?,renaissance_love
"Helas, thy cruelty!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance_love
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance_love
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance_love
"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance_love
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;,renaissance_love
"Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,",renaissance_love
"Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance_love
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.,renaissance_love
"But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;",renaissance_love
"Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;",renaissance_love
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.,renaissance_love
"Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes,",renaissance_love
"Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,",renaissance_love
"Fool, said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write.""",renaissance_love
You that do search for every purling spring,renaissance_love
"Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,",renaissance_love
"And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows",renaissance_love
"Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring;",renaissance_love
Ye that do dictionary's method bring,renaissance_love
"Into your rimes, running in rattling rows;",renaissance_love
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes,renaissance_love
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing:,renaissance_love
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such,renaissance_love
"As do bewray a want of inward touch,",renaissance_love
"And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light.",renaissance_love
"But if, both for your love and skill, your name",renaissance_love
"You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,",renaissance_love
"Stella behold, and then begin to endite.",renaissance_love
"Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly!",renaissance_love
"See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say,",renaissance_love
"Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie",renaissance_love
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.,renaissance_love
"So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,",renaissance_love
"Nor so fair level in so secret stay,",renaissance_love
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;,renaissance_love
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.,renaissance_love
"Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,",renaissance_love
"And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place,",renaissance_love
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;,renaissance_love
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace,renaissance_love
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart:,renaissance_love
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart.,renaissance_love
"The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness",renaissance_love
"Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise,",renaissance_love
With idle pains and missing aim do guess.,renaissance_love
"Some, that know how my spring I did address,",renaissance_love
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies;,renaissance_love
"Others, because the prince my service tries,",renaissance_love
Think that I think state errors to redress;,renaissance_love
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei,renaissance_love
"Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei",renaissance_love
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage.,renaissance_love
"O fool or over-wise! alas, the race",renaissance_love
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start,renaissance_love
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.,renaissance_love
"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,",renaissance_love
"That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told;",renaissance_love
"Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine,",renaissance_love
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold.,renaissance_love
"Or else let them in statelier glory shine,",renaissance_love
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old;,renaissance_love
"Or with strange similes enrich each line,",renaissance_love
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.,renaissance_love
"For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;",renaissance_love
"Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,",renaissance_love
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.,renaissance_love
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read,renaissance_love
What love and beauty be; then all my deed,renaissance_love
"But copying is, what in her Nature writes.",renaissance_love
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!",renaissance_love
"How silently, and with how wan a face!",renaissance_love
"What, may it be that even in heav'nly place",renaissance_love
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace,renaissance_love
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance_love
"Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance_love
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",renaissance_love
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"I might!unhappy wordO me, I might,",renaissance_love
"And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;",renaissance_love
"Till now wrapt in a most infernal night,",renaissance_love
"I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.",renaissance_love
"Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;",renaissance_love
"No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,",renaissance_love
"No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,",renaissance_love
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;,renaissance_love
"But to myself myself did give the blow,",renaissance_love
"While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me",renaissance_love
That I respects for both our sakes must show:,renaissance_love
And yet could not by rising morn foresee,renaissance_love
"How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"That I had been more foolish,or more wise!Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,",renaissance_love
"The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,",renaissance_love
"The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,",renaissance_love
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.,renaissance_love
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease,renaissance_love
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:,renaissance_love
O make in me those civil wars to cease;,renaissance_love
"I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.",renaissance_love
"Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,",renaissance_love
"A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,",renaissance_love
A rosy garland and a weary head:,renaissance_love
"And if these things, as being thine by right,",renaissance_love
"Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,",renaissance_love
"Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.",renaissance_love
"Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance",renaissance_love
"Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,",renaissance_love
Both by the judgment of the English eyes,renaissance_love
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;,renaissance_love
"Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,",renaissance_love
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies,renaissance_love
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;,renaissance_love
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;,renaissance_love
"Others, because of both sides I do take",renaissance_love
"My blood from them who did excel in this,",renaissance_love
Think Nature me a man of arms did make.,renaissance_love
"How far they shot awry! The true cause is,",renaissance_love
"Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face",renaissance_love
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.,renaissance_love
"No more, my dear, no more these counsels try;",renaissance_love
"Oh, give my passions leave to run their race;",renaissance_love
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace;,renaissance_love
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry;,renaissance_love
"Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye;",renaissance_love
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace;,renaissance_love
"Let all the earth with scorn recount my case,",renaissance_love
But do not will me from my love to fly.,renaissance_love
"I do not envy Aristotle's wit,",renaissance_love
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame;,renaissance_love

But that which once may win thy cruel heart:,renaissance_love
"Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.",renaissance_love
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,",renaissance_love
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?,renaissance_love
"Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,",renaissance_love
"Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?",renaissance_love
"Or did she else that sober hue devise,",renaissance_love
In object best to knit and strength our sight;,renaissance_love
"Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,",renaissance_love
"They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?",renaissance_love

She even in black doth make all beauties flow?,renaissance_love
"Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be",renaissance_love

Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.,renaissance_love
"So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love,",renaissance_love
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good:,renaissance_love
"But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!""",renaissance_love
"Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,",renaissance_love
"And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,",renaissance_love

More oft than to a chamber melody.,renaissance_love
"Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me",renaissance_love
"To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:",renaissance_love
My Muse and I must you of duty greet,renaissance_love

Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.,renaissance_love
"Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware,",renaissance_love
That you allow me them by so small rate?,renaissance_love
Or do you cutted Spartans imitate?,renaissance_love
"Or do you mean my tender ears to spare,",renaissance_love
That to my questions you so total are?,renaissance_love
"When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state,",renaissance_love
"You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:",renaissance_love

I would know whether she did sit or walk;,renaissance_love
"How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd;",renaissance_love
"Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk;",renaissance_love
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled;,renaissance_love
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name.,renaissance_love
"Say all; and all well said, still say the same.",renaissance_love
Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes,renaissance_love
"Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,",renaissance_love
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth,renaissance_love
For to rest in his worldly paradise,renaissance_love
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.,renaissance_love

Whereby with himself on love he plaineth,renaissance_love
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.,renaissance_love

I need not their light having thee.,renaissance_love
"Let others freeze with angling reeds,",renaissance_love

"Or treacherously poor fish beset,",renaissance_love
"With strangling snare, or windowy net.",renaissance_love

The bedded fish in banks out-wrest;,renaissance_love

         So you will let me love.,renaissance_love
"Alas, alas, who's injured by my love?",renaissance_love
         What merchant's ships have my sighs drowned?,renaissance_love
Who says my tears have overflowed his ground?,renaissance_love
         When did my colds a forward spring remove?,renaissance_love
                When did the heats which my veins fill,renaissance_love
                Add one more to the plaguy bill?,renaissance_love
"Soldiers find wars, and lawyers find out still",renaissance_love
"         Litigious men, which quarrels move,",renaissance_love

"With the ardour and the passion,",renaissance_love
Gives the lover weight and fashion.,renaissance_love
"If you then will read the story,",renaissance_love
First prepare you to be sorry,renaissance_love

Than words that soothe her;,renaissance_love
"And from her arched brows, such a grace",renaissance_love
Sheds itself through the face,renaissance_love
As alone there triumphs to the life,renaissance_love
"All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.",renaissance_love
"Have you seen but a bright lily grow,",renaissance_love
Before rude hands have touch'd it?,renaissance_love

Before the soil hath smutch'd it?,renaissance_love
Ha' you felt the wool o' the beaver?,renaissance_love
Or swan's down ever?,renaissance_love
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar?,renaissance_love
Or the nard in the fire?,renaissance_love
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?,renaissance_love
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is she!,renaissance_love
"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,",renaissance_love
And lovers kindling your enraged fires,renaissance_love
"At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,",renaissance_love
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;,renaissance_love
You that prefer the painted cabinet,renaissance_love
"Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,",renaissance_love
"That all your joys in dying figures set,",renaissance_love
And stain the living substance of your glory;,renaissance_love
"Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,",renaissance_love

"Of love, and honour's complete history.",renaissance_love
Your eyes were never yet let in to see,renaissance_love
"The majesty and riches of the mind,",renaissance_love
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind.,renaissance_love
"Dear love, for nothing less than thee",renaissance_love
Would I have broke this happy dream;,renaissance_love
            It was a theme,renaissance_love
"For reason, much too strong for fantasy,",renaissance_love
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet,renaissance_love
"My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.",renaissance_love
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice,renaissance_love
"To make dreams truths, and fables histories;",renaissance_love
"Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,",renaissance_love
"Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.",renaissance_love
"   As lightning, or a taper's light,",renaissance_love
"Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;",renaissance_love
            Yet I thought thee,renaissance_love
"(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;",renaissance_love
"But when I saw thou sawest my heart,",renaissance_love
"And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,",renaissance_love
"When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when",renaissance_love
"Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,",renaissance_love
"I must confess, it could not choose but be",renaissance_love
"Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.",renaissance_love
"   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,",renaissance_love
"But rising makes me doubt, that now",renaissance_love
            Thou art not thou.,renaissance_love
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;,renaissance_love
"'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,",renaissance_love

"Perchance as torches, which must ready be,",renaissance_love
"Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;",renaissance_love
"Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I",renaissance_love
"Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",renaissance_love
"Where, like a pillow on a bed",renaissance_love
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest,renaissance_love
"The violet's reclining head,",renaissance_love
"         Sat we two, one another's best.",renaissance_love
Our hands were firmly cemented,renaissance_love
"         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;",renaissance_love
"Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread",renaissance_love
         Our eyes upon one double string;,renaissance_love
"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance_love
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance_love
And pictures in our eyes to get,renaissance_love
         Was all our propagation.,renaissance_love
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance_love
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance_love
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance_love
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance_love
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance_love
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance_love
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance_love
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance_love
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance_love
"         That he soul's language understood,",renaissance_love
"And by good love were grown all mind,",renaissance_love
"         Within convenient distance stood,",renaissance_love
"He (though he knew not which soul spake,",renaissance_love
"         Because both meant, both spake the same)",renaissance_love
Might thence a new concoction take,renaissance_love
         And part far purer than he came.,renaissance_love
"This ecstasy doth unperplex,",renaissance_love
"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance_love
"We see by this it was not sex,",renaissance_love
         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance_love
But as all several souls contain,renaissance_love
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance_love
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance_love
"         And makes both one, each this and that.",renaissance_love
"A single violet transplant,",renaissance_love
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance_love
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance_love
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance_love
When love with one another so,renaissance_love
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance_love
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance_love
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance_love
"We then, who are this new soul, know",renaissance_love
"         Of what we are compos'd and made,",renaissance_love
For th' atomies of which we grow,renaissance_love
"         Are souls, whom no change can invade.",renaissance_love
"But oh alas, so long, so far,",renaissance_love
         Our bodies why do we forbear?,renaissance_love
"They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are",renaissance_love
"         The intelligences, they the spheres.",renaissance_love
"We owe them thanks, because they thus",renaissance_love
"         Did us, to us, at first convey,",renaissance_love
"Yielded their senses' force to us,",renaissance_love
"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance_love
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance_love
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance_love
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance_love
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance_love
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance_love
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance_love
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance_love
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance_love
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance_love

         Nor question much,renaissance_love
"That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;",renaissance_love

"Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,",renaissance_love
         Will leave this to control,renaissance_love
"And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.",renaissance_love
For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall,renaissance_love
         Through every part,renaissance_love
"Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,",renaissance_love
"Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art",renaissance_love
"         Have from a better brain,",renaissance_love
Can better do'it; except she meant that I,renaissance_love

"As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die.",renaissance_love
"Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me,",renaissance_love
         For since I am,renaissance_love
"Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,",renaissance_love
If into other hands these relics came;,renaissance_love
         As 'twas humility,renaissance_love
"To afford to it all that a soul can do,",renaissance_love
"         So, 'tis some bravery,",renaissance_love
"That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.",renaissance_love
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I",renaissance_love
"Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?",renaissance_love
"But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?",renaissance_love
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers den?,renaissance_love
"Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.",renaissance_love
"If ever any beauty I did see,",renaissance_love
"Which I desired, and got, twas but a dream of thee.",renaissance_love
"And now good-morrow to our waking souls,",renaissance_love

The heart and service to you proffer'd,renaissance_love
"With right good will full honestly,",renaissance_love
"Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,",renaissance_love
But take it to you gentlely.,renaissance_love
"And though it be a small present,",renaissance_love
"Yet good, consider graciously",renaissance_love
"The thought, the mind, and the intent",renaissance_love
Of him that loves you faithfully.,renaissance_love
It were a thing of small effect,renaissance_love
"To work my woe thus cruelly,",renaissance_love
For my good will to be abject:,renaissance_love
Therefore accept it lovingly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or travel, to run or ride,",renaissance_love
I undertake it pleasantly;,renaissance_love
"Bid ye me go, and straight I glide",renaissance_love
At your commandement humbly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or pleasure, now may you plant",renaissance_love
Even which it please you steadfastly;,renaissance_love

Reward your servant liberally.,renaissance_love
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,",renaissance_love
"In view and opposite two cities stood,",renaissance_love
"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;",renaissance_love
"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",renaissance_love
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",renaissance_love
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",renaissance_love
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",renaissance_love
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance_love
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance_love
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance_love
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance_love
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance_love
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance_love
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance_love
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance_love
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance_love
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance_love
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance_love
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance_love
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance_love
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance_love
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance_love
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance_love
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance_love
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance_love
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance_love
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance_love
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance_love
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance_love
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance_love
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance_love
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance_love
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance_love
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance_love
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance_love
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance_love
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance_love
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance_love
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance_love
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance_love
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance_love
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance_love
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance_love
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance_love
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance_love
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance_love
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance_love
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance_love
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance_love
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance_love
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance_love
"(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),",renaissance_love
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance_love
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance_love
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance_love
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance_love
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance_love
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance_love
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance_love
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance_love
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance_love
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance_love
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance_love
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance_love
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance_love
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance_love
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance_love
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance_love
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance_love
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance_love
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance_love
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance_love
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance_love
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance_love
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance_love
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance_love
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance_love
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance_love
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance_love
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance_love
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance_love
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance_love
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance_love
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance_love
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance_love
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance_love
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance_love
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance_love
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance_love
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance_love
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance_love
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance_love
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance_love
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance_love
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance_love
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance_love
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance_love
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance_love
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance_love
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance_love
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance_love
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance_love
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance_love
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance_love
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance_love
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance_love
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance_love
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance_love
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance_love
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance_love
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance_love
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance_love
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance_love
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance_love
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance_love
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance_love
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance_love
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance_love
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance_love
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance_love
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance_love
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance_love
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance_love
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance_love
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance_love
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance_love
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance_love
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance_love
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance_love
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance_love
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance_love
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance_love
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance_love
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance_love
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance_love
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance_love
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance_love
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance_love
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance_love
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance_love
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance_love
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance_love
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance_love
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance_love
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance_love
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance_love
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance_love
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance_love
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance_love
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance_love
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance_love
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance_love
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance_love
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance_love
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance_love
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance_love
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance_love
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance_love
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance_love
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance_love
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance_love
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance_love
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance_love
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance_love
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance_love
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance_love
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance_love
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance_love
And one especially do we affect,renaissance_love
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance_love
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance_love
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance_love
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance_love
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",renaissance_love
"Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear.",renaissance_love
What! is it she which on the other shore,renaissance_love
"Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,",renaissance_love
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?,renaissance_love
"Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?",renaissance_love
"Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?",renaissance_love
"Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore",renaissance_love
"On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?",renaissance_love
"Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights",renaissance_love
"First travel we to seek, and then make love?",renaissance_love
"Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,",renaissance_love
"And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove,",renaissance_love
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then,renaissance_love
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men.,renaissance_love
Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt,renaissance_love
"To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,",renaissance_love
"And her soul early into heaven ravished,",renaissance_love
Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.,renaissance_love
Here the admiring her my mind did whet,renaissance_love
"To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;",renaissance_love
"But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,",renaissance_love
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.,renaissance_love
"But why should I beg more love, whenas thou",renaissance_love
"Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,",renaissance_love
And dost not only fear lest I allow,renaissance_love
"My love to saints and angels, things divine,",renaissance_love
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt,renaissance_love
"Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",renaissance_love
"I find no peace, and all my war is done.",renaissance_love
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.,renaissance_love
"I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;",renaissance_love
"And nought I have, and all the world I season.",renaissance_love
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison,renaissance_love
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise,renaissance_love
"Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,",renaissance_love
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.,renaissance_love
"Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.",renaissance_love
"I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.",renaissance_love
"I love another, and thus I hate myself.",renaissance_love
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;,renaissance_love
"Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,",renaissance_love
And my delight is causer of this strife.,renaissance_love
"Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,",renaissance_love
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying,renaissance_love
"Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:",renaissance_love
"Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else",renaissance_love
"Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else",renaissance_love
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.,renaissance_love
"If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:",renaissance_love
"If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:",renaissance_love
"If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.",renaissance_love
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:,renaissance_love
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:,renaissance_love
"Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.",renaissance_love
"Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:",renaissance_love
"Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:",renaissance_love
"Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.",renaissance_love
"And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?",renaissance_love
"And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?",renaissance_love
"And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?",renaissance_love
"I can love both fair and brown,",renaissance_love
"Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,",renaissance_love
"Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,",renaissance_love
"Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,",renaissance_love
"Her who believes, and her who tries,",renaissance_love
"Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,",renaissance_love
"And her who is dry cork, and never cries;",renaissance_love
"I can love her, and her, and you, and you,",renaissance_love
"I can love any, so she be not true.",renaissance_love
Will no other vice content you?,renaissance_love
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?,renaissance_love
"Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?",renaissance_love
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?,renaissance_love
"O we are not, be not you so;",renaissance_love
"Let me, and do you, twenty know.",renaissance_love
"Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.",renaissance_love
"Must I, who came to travail thorough you,",renaissance_love
"Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?",renaissance_love
"Venus heard me sigh this song,",renaissance_love
"And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,",renaissance_love
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.,renaissance_love
"She went, examined, and returned ere long,",renaissance_love
"And said, Alas! some two or three",renaissance_love
"Poor heretics in love there be,",renaissance_love
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.,renaissance_love
"But I have told them, Since you will be true,",renaissance_love
You shall be true to them who are false to you.,renaissance_love
"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;",renaissance_love
"And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;",renaissance_love
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;,renaissance_love
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.,renaissance_love
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might,renaissance_love
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;,renaissance_love
"Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,",renaissance_love
That both doth shine and give us sight to see.,renaissance_love
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide,renaissance_love
"In this small course which birth draws out to death,",renaissance_love
"And think how evil becometh him to slide,",renaissance_love
"Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.",renaissance_love
"Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:",renaissance_love
"Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.",renaissance_love
"Stand still, and I will read to thee",renaissance_love
"A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.",renaissance_love
"         These three hours that we have spent,",renaissance_love
"         Walking here, two shadows went",renaissance_love
"Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.",renaissance_love
"But, now the sun is just above our head,",renaissance_love
"         We do those shadows tread,",renaissance_love
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.,renaissance_love
"So whilst our infant loves did grow,",renaissance_love
"Disguises did, and shadows, flow",renaissance_love
"From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.",renaissance_love
"That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,",renaissance_love
Which is still diligent lest others see.,renaissance_love
"Except our loves at this noon stay,",renaissance_love
We shall new shadows make the other way.,renaissance_love
         As the first were made to blind,renaissance_love
"         Others, these which come behind",renaissance_love
"Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.",renaissance_love
"If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,",renaissance_love
"         To me thou, falsely, thine,",renaissance_love
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.,renaissance_love
"The morning shadows wear away,",renaissance_love
But these grow longer all the day;,renaissance_love
"But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.",renaissance_love
"Love is a growing, or full constant light,",renaissance_love
"And his first minute, after noon, is night.",renaissance_love
The longe love that in my thought doth harbour,renaissance_love
"And in mine hert doth keep his residence,",renaissance_love
Into my face presseth with bold pretence,renaissance_love
"And therein campeth, spreading his banner.",renaissance_love
She that me learneth to love and suffer,renaissance_love
And will that my trust and lustes negligence,renaissance_love
"Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,",renaissance_love
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.,renaissance_love
"Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,",renaissance_love
"Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,",renaissance_love
And there him hideth and not appeareth.,renaissance_love
What may I do when my master feareth,renaissance_love
But in the field with him to live and die?,renaissance_love
For good is the life ending faithfully.,renaissance_love
"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,",renaissance_love
"Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;",renaissance_love
"         I have lov'd, and got, and told,",renaissance_love
"But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,",renaissance_love
I should not find that hidden mystery.,renaissance_love
"         Oh, 'tis imposture all!",renaissance_love
"And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,",renaissance_love
         But glorifies his pregnant pot,renaissance_love
         If by the way to him befall,renaissance_love
"Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,",renaissance_love
"         So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,",renaissance_love
         But get a winter-seeming summer's night.,renaissance_love
"Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day,",renaissance_love
Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?,renaissance_love
"         Ends love in this, that my man",renaissance_love
"Can be as happy'as I can, if he can",renaissance_love
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?,renaissance_love
         That loving wretch that swears,renaissance_love
"'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,",renaissance_love
"         Which he in her angelic finds,",renaissance_love
"         Would swear as justly that he hears,",renaissance_love
"In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.",renaissance_love
         Hope not for mind in women; at their best,renaissance_love
"         Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.",renaissance_love
"         I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,",renaissance_love
      Who died before the god of love was born.,renaissance_love
"I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,",renaissance_love
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.,renaissance_love
"But since this god produc'd a destiny,",renaissance_love
"And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,",renaissance_love
"      I must love her, that loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,",renaissance_love
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.,renaissance_love
"But when an even flame two hearts did touch,",renaissance_love
      His office was indulgently to fit,renaissance_love
Actives to passives. Correspondency,renaissance_love
Only his subject was; it cannot be,renaissance_love
"      Love, till I love her, that loves me.",renaissance_love
   But every modern god will now extend,renaissance_love
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.,renaissance_love
"To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,",renaissance_love
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.,renaissance_love
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny,renaissance_love
"To ungod this child again, it could not be",renaissance_love
"      I should love her, who loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,",renaissance_love
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?,renaissance_love
"Love might make me leave loving, or might try",renaissance_love
"      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;",renaissance_love
"Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.",renaissance_love
"Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,",renaissance_love
"      If she whom I love, should love me.",renaissance_love
"      If yet I have not all thy love,",renaissance_love
"Dear, I shall never have it all;",renaissance_love
"I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,",renaissance_love
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;,renaissance_love
"And all my treasure, which should purchase thee",renaissance_love
"Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.",renaissance_love
"Yet no more can be due to me,",renaissance_love
Than at the bargain made was meant;,renaissance_love
"If then thy gift of love were partial,",renaissance_love
"That some to me, some should to others fall,",renaissance_love
"         Dear, I shall never have thee all.",renaissance_love
"Or if then thou gavest me all,",renaissance_love
"All was but all, which thou hadst then;",renaissance_love
"But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall",renaissance_love
"New love created be, by other men,",renaissance_love
"Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,",renaissance_love
"In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,",renaissance_love
"This new love may beget new fears,",renaissance_love
For this love was not vow'd by thee.,renaissance_love
"And yet it was, thy gift being general;",renaissance_love
"The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall",renaissance_love
"         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.",renaissance_love
"Yet I would not have all yet,",renaissance_love
He that hath all can have no more;,renaissance_love
And since my love doth every day admit,renaissance_love
"New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;",renaissance_love
"Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,",renaissance_love
"If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;",renaissance_love
"Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,",renaissance_love
"It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;",renaissance_love
"But we will have a way more liberal,",renaissance_love
"Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall",renaissance_love
"         Be one, and one another's all.",renaissance_love
"         Madam, withouten many words",renaissance_love
    Once I am sure ye will or no ...,renaissance_love
"And if ye will, then leave your bourds",renaissance_love
"    And use your wit and show it so,",renaissance_love
And with a beck ye shall me call;,renaissance_love
    And if of one that burneth alway,renaissance_love
"Ye have any pity at all,",renaissance_love
    Answer him fair with & {.} or nay.,renaissance_love
"If it be &, {.} I shall be fain;",renaissance_love
"    If it be nay, friends as before;",renaissance_love
"Ye shall another man obtain,",renaissance_love
    And I mine own and yours no more.,renaissance_love
    My lute awake! perform the last,renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And end that I have now begun;,renaissance_love
"For when this song is sung and past,",renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"As to be heard where ear is none,",renaissance_love
"As lead to grave in marble stone,",renaissance_love
My song may pierce her heart as soon;,renaissance_love
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?,renaissance_love
"No, no, my lute, for I have done.",renaissance_love
The rocks do not so cruelly,renaissance_love
"Repulse the waves continually,",renaissance_love
As she my suit and affection;,renaissance_love
"So that I am past remedy,",renaissance_love
Whereby my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Proud of the spoil that thou hast got,renaissance_love
"Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,",renaissance_love
"By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,",renaissance_love
"Think not he hath his bow forgot,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain,renaissance_love
That makest but game on earnest pain.,renaissance_love
Think not alone under the sun,renaissance_love
"Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Perchance thee lie wethered and old,renaissance_love
"The winter nights that are so cold,",renaissance_love
Plaining in vain unto the moon;,renaissance_love
Thy wishes then dare not be told;,renaissance_love
"Care then who list, for I have done.",renaissance_love
And then may chance thee to repent,renaissance_love
The time that thou hast lost and spent,renaissance_love
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;,renaissance_love
"Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,",renaissance_love
And wish and want as I have done.,renaissance_love
"Now cease, my lute; this is the last",renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And ended is that we begun.,renaissance_love
Now is this song both sung and past:,renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,",renaissance_love
For else it could not be,renaissance_love
"That she,",renaissance_love
"Whom I adore so much, should so slight me",renaissance_love
And cast my love behind.,renaissance_love
"I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,",renaissance_love
And every close did meet,renaissance_love
"In sentence of as subtle feet,",renaissance_love
As hath the youngest He,renaissance_love
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.,renaissance_love
"O, but my conscious fears,",renaissance_love
"That fly my thoughts between,",renaissance_love
Tell me that she hath seen,renaissance_love
"My hundred of gray hairs,",renaissance_love
Told seven and forty years,renaissance_love
"Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace",renaissance_love
My mountain belly and my rocky face;,renaissance_love
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears.,renaissance_love
"Come live with me and be my love,",renaissance_love
"And we will all the pleasures prove,",renaissance_love
"That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,",renaissance_love
"Woods, or steepy mountain yields.",renaissance_love
"And we will sit upon the Rocks,",renaissance_love
"Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,",renaissance_love
By shallow Rivers to whose falls,renaissance_love
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.,renaissance_love
And I will make thee beds of Roses,renaissance_love
"And a thousand fragrant posies,",renaissance_love
"A cap of flowers, and a kirtle",renaissance_love
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;,renaissance_love
A gown made of the finest wool,renaissance_love
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;,renaissance_love
"Fair lined slippers for the cold,",renaissance_love
With buckles of the purest gold;,renaissance_love
"A belt of straw and Ivy buds,",renaissance_love
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:,renaissance_love
"And if these pleasures may thee move,",renaissance_love
"Come live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing,renaissance_love
For thy delight each May-morning:,renaissance_love
"If these delights thy mind may move,",renaissance_love
"Then live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
When my grave is broke up again,renaissance_love
"       Some second guest to entertain,",renaissance_love
"       (For graves have learn'd that woman head,",renaissance_love
       To be to more than one a bed),renaissance_love
"                And he that digs it, spies",renaissance_love
"A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,",renaissance_love
"                Will he not let'us alone,",renaissance_love
"And think that there a loving couple lies,",renaissance_love
Who thought that this device might be some way,renaissance_love
"To make their souls, at the last busy day,",renaissance_love
"Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?",renaissance_love
"         If this fall in a time, or land,",renaissance_love
"         Where mis-devotion doth command,",renaissance_love
"         Then he, that digs us up, will bring",renaissance_love
"         Us to the bishop, and the king,",renaissance_love
                To make us relics; then,renaissance_love
"Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I",renaissance_love
                A something else thereby;,renaissance_love
"All women shall adore us, and some men;",renaissance_love
"And since at such time miracles are sought,",renaissance_love
I would have that age by this paper taught,renaissance_love
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.,renaissance_love
"         First, we lov'd well and faithfully,",renaissance_love
"         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;",renaissance_love
         Difference of sex no more we knew,renaissance_love
         Than our guardian angels do;,renaissance_love
"                Coming and going, we",renaissance_love
"Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;",renaissance_love
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,renaissance_love
"Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free;",renaissance_love
"These miracles we did, but now alas,",renaissance_love
"All measure, and all language, I should pass,",renaissance_love
Should I tell what a miracle she was.,renaissance_love
"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;",renaissance_love
For Love is dead,renaissance_love
"All love is dead, infected",renaissance_love
With plague of deep disdain;,renaissance_love
"Worth, as nought worth, rejected,",renaissance_love
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said",renaissance_love
That Love is dead?,renaissance_love
"His death-bed, peacock's folly;",renaissance_love
His winding-sheet is shame;,renaissance_love
"His will, false-seeming holy;",renaissance_love
"His sole exec'tor, blame.",renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,",renaissance_love
For Love is dead;,renaissance_love
Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth,renaissance_love
"My mistress' marble heart,",renaissance_love
"Which epitaph containeth,",renaissance_love
Her eyes were once his dart.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;",renaissance_love
Love is not dead;,renaissance_love
"Love is not dead, but sleepeth",renaissance_love
"In her unmatched mind,",renaissance_love
"Where she his counsel keepeth,",renaissance_love
Till due desert she find.,renaissance_love
"Therefore from so vile fancy,",renaissance_love
"To call such wit a franzy,",renaissance_love
"Who Love can temper thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,",renaissance_love
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's,renaissance_love
"Silent music, either other",renaissance_love
Sweetly gracing.,renaissance_love
Lovely forms do flow,renaissance_love
From concent divinely framed;,renaissance_love
"Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's",renaissance_love
Birth is heavenly.,renaissance_love
These dull notes we sing,renaissance_love
Discords need for helps to grace them;,renaissance_love
Only beauty purely loving,renaissance_love
"Knows no discord,",renaissance_love
"But still moves delight,",renaissance_love
"Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,",renaissance_love
"Ever perfect, ever in them-",renaissance_love
"Selves eternal.Since so ye please to hear me plain,",renaissance_love
"And that ye do rejoice my smart,",renaissance_love
Me list no lenger to remain,renaissance_love
To such as be so overthwart.,renaissance_love
But cursed be that cruel heart,renaissance_love
Which hath procurd a careless mind,renaissance_love
"For me and mine unfeigned smart,",renaissance_love
And forceth me such faults to find.,renaissance_love
More than too much I am assured,renaissance_love
"Of thine intent, whereto to trust;",renaissance_love
"A speedless proof I have endured,",renaissance_love
And now I leave it to them that lust.,renaissance_love
"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,",renaissance_love
By just exchange one for the other given:,renaissance_love
"I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;",renaissance_love
There never was a bargain better driven.,renaissance_love
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;,renaissance_love
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:,renaissance_love
"He loves my heart, for once it was his own;",renaissance_love
I cherish his because in me it bides.,renaissance_love
His heart his wound received from my sight;,renaissance_love
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;,renaissance_love
"For as from me on him his hurt did light,",renaissance_love
"So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:",renaissance_love
"Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,",renaissance_love
My true love hath my heart and I have his.,renaissance_love
"Go and catch a falling star,",renaissance_love

"    Or who cleft the devil's foot,",renaissance_love
"Teach me to hear mermaids singing,",renaissance_love
"Or to keep off envy's stinging,",renaissance_love

Serves to advance an honest mind.,renaissance_love

"            And swear,",renaissance_love
            No where,renaissance_love
"Lives a woman true, and fair.",renaissance_love
"If thou find'st one, let me know,",renaissance_love
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;,renaissance_love
"Yet do not, I would not go,",renaissance_love
    Though at next door we might meet;,renaissance_love
"Though she were true, when you met her,",renaissance_love
"And last, till you write your letter,",renaissance_love
            Yet she,renaissance_love
            Will be,renaissance_love
"False, ere I come, to two, or three.",renaissance_love
The student may give either title during the recitation.,renaissance_love

Nor in hope the world can show,renaissance_love
         A fitter love for me;,renaissance_love
                But since that I,renaissance_love
"Must die at last, 'tis best",renaissance_love

But believe that I shall make,renaissance_love
"Speedier journeys, since I take",renaissance_love
         More wings and spurs than he.,renaissance_love
"O how feeble is man's power,",renaissance_love
"         That if good fortune fall,",renaissance_love
"Cannot add another hour,",renaissance_love

         But sigh'st my soul away;,renaissance_love
"When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,",renaissance_love
         My life's blood doth decay.,renaissance_love
                It cannot be,renaissance_love
"That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,",renaissance_love
"If in thine my life thou waste,",renaissance_love
         That art the best of me.,renaissance_love
Let not thy divining heart,renaissance_love
         Forethink me any ill;,renaissance_love
"Destiny may take thy part,",renaissance_love
         And may thy fears fulfil;,renaissance_love
                But think that we,renaissance_love
Are but turn'd aside to sleep;,renaissance_love
They who one another keep,renaissance_love
"         Alive, ne'er parted be.",renaissance_love
"         Take, oh take those lips away,",renaissance_love
"      That so sweetly were forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And those eyes: the breake of day,",renaissance_love
      Lights that do mislead the Morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again, bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Drink to me only with thine eyes,",renaissance_love
         And I will pledge with mine;,renaissance_love
"Or leave a kiss but in the cup,",renaissance_love
         And Ill not look for wine.,renaissance_love
The thirst that from the soul doth rise,renaissance_love
         Doth ask a drink divine;,renaissance_love
"But might I of Joves nectar sup,",renaissance_love
         I would not change for thine.,renaissance_love
"I sent thee late a rosy wreath,",renaissance_love
         Not so much honouring thee,renaissance_love
"As giving it a hope, that there",renaissance_love
         It could not withered be.,renaissance_love
"But thou thereon didst only breathe,",renaissance_love
         And sentst it back to me;,renaissance_love
"Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,",renaissance_love
"         Not of itself, but thee.",renaissance_love
         When I consider everything that grows,renaissance_love
"Holds in perfection but a little moment,",renaissance_love
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,renaissance_love
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;,renaissance_love
"When I perceive that men as plants increase,",renaissance_love
"Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,",renaissance_love
"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,",renaissance_love
And wear their brave state out of memory;,renaissance_love
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,renaissance_love
"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,",renaissance_love
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,renaissance_love
To change your day of youth to sullied night;,renaissance_love
"And all in war with Time for love of you,",renaissance_love
"As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",renaissance_love
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,",renaissance_love
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;,renaissance_love
"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,",renaissance_love
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;,renaissance_love
"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,",renaissance_love
"And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,",renaissance_love
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;,renaissance_love
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:,renaissance_love
"O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,",renaissance_love
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!,renaissance_love
Him in thy course untainted do allow,renaissance_love
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.,renaissance_love
"Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong",renaissance_love
My love shall in my verse ever live young.,renaissance_love
Let those who are in favour with their stars,renaissance_love
"Of public honour and proud titles boast,",renaissance_love
"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,",renaissance_love
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.,renaissance_love
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,renaissance_love
"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,",renaissance_love
"And in themselves their pride lies buried,",renaissance_love
For at a frown they in their glory die.,renaissance_love
"The painful warrior famoused for fight,",renaissance_love
"After a thousand victories once foil'd,",renaissance_love
"Is from the book of honour razed quite,",renaissance_love
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:,renaissance_love
"Then happy I, that love and am beloved",renaissance_love
Where I may not remove nor be removed.,renaissance_love
"When, in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,",renaissance_love
"I all alone beweep my outcast state,",renaissance_love
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",renaissance_love
"And look upon myself and curse my fate,",renaissance_love
"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",renaissance_love
"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",renaissance_love
"Desiring this mans art and that mans scope,",renaissance_love
With what I most enjoy contented least;,renaissance_love
"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",renaissance_love
"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,",renaissance_love
(Like to the lark at break of day arising,renaissance_love
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heavens gate;,renaissance_love
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,renaissance_love
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,renaissance_love
       When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,renaissance_love
"I summon up remembrance of things past,",renaissance_love
"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",renaissance_love
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:,renaissance_love
"Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,",renaissance_love
"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",renaissance_love
"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",renaissance_love
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;,renaissance_love
"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",renaissance_love
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er,renaissance_love
"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",renaissance_love
Which I new pay as if not paid before.,renaissance_love
"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",renaissance_love
"All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.",renaissance_love
"If thou survive my well-contented day,",renaissance_love
"When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,",renaissance_love
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey,renaissance_love
"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,",renaissance_love
"Compare them with the bettering of the time,",renaissance_love
"And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,",renaissance_love
"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,",renaissance_love
Exceeded by the height of happier men.,renaissance_love
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:,renaissance_love
"Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.",renaissance_love
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,renaissance_love
"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,",renaissance_love
"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,",renaissance_love
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;,renaissance_love
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,renaissance_love
With ugly rack on his celestial face,renaissance_love
"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,",renaissance_love
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.,renaissance_love
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,renaissance_love
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;,renaissance_love
"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;",renaissance_love
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.,renaissance_love
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;,renaissance_love
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.,renaissance_love
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,",renaissance_love
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?,renaissance_love
"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,",renaissance_love
"And you, but one, can every shadow lend.",renaissance_love
"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit",renaissance_love
Is poorly imitated after you;,renaissance_love
"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,",renaissance_love
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.,renaissance_love
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:,renaissance_love
"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,",renaissance_love
The other as your bounty doth appear;,renaissance_love
And you in every blessed shape we know.,renaissance_love
"    In all external grace you have some part,",renaissance_love
"    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",renaissance_love
    When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,renaissance_love
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;,renaissance_love
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd,renaissance_love
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;,renaissance_love
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain,renaissance_love
"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,",renaissance_love
"And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,",renaissance_love
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;,renaissance_love
"When I have seen such interchange of state,",renaissance_love
Or state itself confounded to decay;,renaissance_love
"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,",renaissance_love
That Time will come and take my love away.,renaissance_love
"This thought is as a death, which cannot choose",renaissance_love
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,",renaissance_love
"As, to behold desert a beggar born,",renaissance_love
"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,",renaissance_love
"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,",renaissance_love
"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,",renaissance_love
"And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,",renaissance_love
"And strength by limping sway disabled,",renaissance_love
"And art made tongue-tied by authority,",renaissance_love
"And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,",renaissance_love
"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,",renaissance_love
And captive good attending captain ill.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,",renaissance_love
"Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.",renaissance_love
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,renaissance_love
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell,renaissance_love
Give warning to the world that I am fled,renaissance_love
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; ,renaissance_love
"Nay, if you read this line, remember not",renaissance_love
"The hand that writ it; for I love you so, ",renaissance_love
"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, ",renaissance_love
If thinking on me then should make you woe.,renaissance_love
"O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, ",renaissance_love
"When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,",renaissance_love
"Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,",renaissance_love
"But let your love even with my life decay,",renaissance_love
"Lest the wise world should look into your moan, ",renaissance_love
And mock you with me after I am gone.,renaissance_love
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,renaissance_love
"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang",renaissance_love
"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,",renaissance_love
"Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day,renaissance_love
"As after sunset fadeth in the west,",renaissance_love
"Which by and by black night doth take away,",renaissance_love
"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,renaissance_love
"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,",renaissance_love
"As the death-bed whereon it must expire,",renaissance_love
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.,renaissance_love
"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,",renaissance_love
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.,renaissance_love
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul",renaissance_love
"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,",renaissance_love
"Can yet the lease of my true love control,",renaissance_love
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.,renaissance_love
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,renaissance_love
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;,renaissance_love
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,renaissance_love
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.,renaissance_love
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,renaissance_love
"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,",renaissance_love
"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,",renaissance_love
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;,renaissance_love
"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,",renaissance_love
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.,renaissance_love
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",renaissance_love
"And made myself a motley to the view,",renaissance_love
"Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,",renaissance_love
Made old offences of affections new.,renaissance_love
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth,renaissance_love
"Askance and strangely: but, by all above,",renaissance_love
"These blenches gave my heart another youth,",renaissance_love
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.,renaissance_love
"Now all is done, have what shall have no end!",renaissance_love
"Mine appetite, I never more will grind",renaissance_love
"On newer proof, to try an older friend,",renaissance_love
"A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.",renaissance_love
"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,",renaissance_love
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.,renaissance_love
Let me not to the marriage of true minds,renaissance_love
Admit impediments. Love is not love,renaissance_love
"Which alters when it alteration finds,",renaissance_love
Or bends with the remover to remove.,renaissance_love
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,renaissance_love
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;,renaissance_love
"It is the star to every wand'ring bark,",renaissance_love
"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.",renaissance_love
"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks",renaissance_love
Within his bending sickle's compass come;,renaissance_love
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,",renaissance_love
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.,renaissance_love
"If this be error and upon me prov'd,",renaissance_love
"I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",renaissance_love
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame,renaissance_love
"Is lust in action; and till action, lust",renaissance_love
"Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,",renaissance_love
"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,",renaissance_love
"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,",renaissance_love
"Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had",renaissance_love
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,renaissance_love
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;,renaissance_love
"Mad in pursuit and in possession so,",renaissance_love
"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;",renaissance_love
"A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;",renaissance_love
"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.",renaissance_love
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well,renaissance_love
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.,renaissance_love
    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;,renaissance_love
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;,renaissance_love
"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;",renaissance_love
"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.",renaissance_love
"I have seen roses damasked, red and white,",renaissance_love
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;,renaissance_love
And in some perfumes is there more delight,renaissance_love
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.,renaissance_love
"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know",renaissance_love
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;,renaissance_love
I grant I never saw a goddess go;,renaissance_love
"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.",renaissance_love
"   And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare",renaissance_love
   As any she belied with false compare.,renaissance_love
"   Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,",renaissance_love
"[......] these rebel powers that thee array,",renaissance_love
"Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,",renaissance_love
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?,renaissance_love
"Why so large cost, having so short a lease,",renaissance_love
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?,renaissance_love
"Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,",renaissance_love
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?,renaissance_love
"Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss",renaissance_love
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;,renaissance_love
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;,renaissance_love
"Within be fed, without be rich no more.",renaissance_love
"So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,",renaissance_love
"And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then.",renaissance_love
"Still to be neat, still to be dressed,",renaissance_love
As you were going to a feast;,renaissance_love
"Still to be powdered, still perfumed; ",renaissance_love
"Lady, it is to be presumed,",renaissance_love
"Though art's hid causes are not found,",renaissance_love
"All is not sweet, all is not sound.",renaissance_love
"Give me a look, give me a face,",renaissance_love
That makes simplicity a grace;,renaissance_love
"Robes loosely flowing, hair as free;",renaissance_love
Such sweet neglect more taketh me,renaissance_love
                       Than all th'adulteries of art. ,renaissance_love
"They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.",renaissance_love
"Busy old fool, unruly sun,",renaissance_love
"               Why dost thou thus,",renaissance_love
"Through windows, and through curtains call on us?",renaissance_love
Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?,renaissance_love
"               Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide",renaissance_love
"               Late school boys and sour prentices,",renaissance_love
"         Go tell court huntsmen that the king will ride,",renaissance_love
"         Call country ants to harvest offices,",renaissance_love
"Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,",renaissance_love
"Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.",renaissance_love
"               Thy beams, so reverend and strong",renaissance_love
               Why shouldst thou think?,renaissance_love
"I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,",renaissance_love
But that I would not lose her sight so long;,renaissance_love
"               If her eyes have not blinded thine,",renaissance_love
"               Look, and tomorrow late, tell me,",renaissance_love
         Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine,renaissance_love
"         Be where thou leftst them, or lie here with me.",renaissance_love
"Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,",renaissance_love
"And thou shalt hear, All here in one bed lay.",renaissance_love
"               She's all states, and all princes, I,",renaissance_love
               Nothing else is.,renaissance_love
"Princes do but play us; compared to this,",renaissance_love
"All honor's mimic, all wealth alchemy.",renaissance_love
"               Thou, sun, art half as happy as we,",renaissance_love
               In that the world's contracted thus.,renaissance_love
"         Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be",renaissance_love
"         To warm the world, that's done in warming us.",renaissance_love
"Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;",renaissance_love
"This bed thy center is, these walls, thy sphere.",renaissance_love
There is a garden in her face,renaissance_love
Where roses and white lilies grow;,renaissance_love
A heav'nly paradise is that place,renaissance_love
Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow.,renaissance_love
"There cherries grow which none may buy,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
Those cherries fairly do enclose,renaissance_love
"Of orient pearl a double row,",renaissance_love
"Which when her lovely laughter shows,",renaissance_love
They look like rose-buds fill'd with snow;,renaissance_love
"Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
"Her eyes like angels watch them still,",renaissance_love
"Her brows like bended bows do stand,",renaissance_love
Threat'ning with piercing frowns to kill,renaissance_love
All that attempt with eye or hand,renaissance_love
"Those sacred cherries to come nigh,",renaissance_love
"Till ""Cherry ripe"" themselves do cry.",renaissance_love
They flee from me that sometime did me seek,renaissance_love
"With naked foot, stalking in my chamber.",renaissance_love
"I have seen them gentle, tame, and meek,",renaissance_love
That now are wild and do not remember,renaissance_love
That sometime they put themself in danger,renaissance_love
"To take bread at my hand; and now they range,",renaissance_love
Busily seeking with a continual change.,renaissance_love
Thanked be fortune it hath been otherwise,renaissance_love
"Twenty times better; but once in special,",renaissance_love
"In thin array after a pleasant guise,",renaissance_love
"When her loose gown from her shoulders did fall,",renaissance_love
And she me caught in her arms long and small;,renaissance_love
Therewithall sweetly did me kiss,renaissance_love
"And softly said, Dear heart, how like you this?",renaissance_love
It was no dream: I lay broad waking.,renaissance_love
But all is turned thorough my gentleness,renaissance_love
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;,renaissance_love
"And I have leave to go of her goodness,",renaissance_love
"And she also, to use newfangleness.",renaissance_love
But since that I so kindly am served,renaissance_love
I would fain know what she hath deserved.,renaissance_love
"Thrice toss these oaken ashes in the air,",renaissance_love
"Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair,",renaissance_love
"Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot,",renaissance_love
"And murmur soft ""She will, or she will not.""",renaissance_love
"Go burn these pois'nous weeds in yon blue fire,",renaissance_love
"These screech-owl's feathers and this prickling briar,",renaissance_love
"This cypress gathered at a dead man's grave,",renaissance_love
That all my fears and cares an end may have.,renaissance_love
"Then come, you fairies! dance with me a round;",renaissance_love
Melt her hard heart with your melodious sound.,renaissance_love
In vain are all the charms I can devise:,renaissance_love
She hath an art to break them with her eyes.,renaissance_love
"Unstable dream, according to the place,",renaissance_love
"Be steadfast once, or else at least be true.",renaissance_love
By tasted sweetness make me not to rue,renaissance_love
The sudden loss of thy false feigned grace.,renaissance_love
By good respect in such a dangerous case,renaissance_love
Thou broughtest not her into this tossing mew,renaissance_love
"But madest my sprite live, my care to renew,",renaissance_love
My body in tempest her succour to embrace.,renaissance_love
"The body dead, the sprite had his desire,",renaissance_love
"Painless was th'one, th'other in delight.",renaissance_love
"Why then, alas, did it not keep it right,",renaissance_love
"Returning, to leap into the fire?",renaissance_love
"     And where it was at wish, it could not remain,",renaissance_love
     Such mocks of dreams they turn to deadly pain.,renaissance_love
"     As virtuous men pass mildly away,",renaissance_love
"   And whisper to their souls to go,",renaissance_love
Whilst some of their sad friends do say,renaissance_love
"   The breath goes now, and some say, No:",renaissance_love
"So let us melt, and make no noise,",renaissance_love
"   No tear-floods, nor sigh-tempests move;",renaissance_love
'Twere profanation of our joys,renaissance_love
   To tell the laity our love.,renaissance_love
"Moving of th' earth brings harms and fears,",renaissance_love
"   Men reckon what it did, and meant;",renaissance_love
"But trepidation of the spheres,",renaissance_love
"   Though greater far, is innocent.",renaissance_love
Dull sublunary lovers' love,renaissance_love
   (Whose soul is sense) cannot admit,renaissance_love
"Absence, because it doth remove",renaissance_love
   Those things which elemented it.,renaissance_love
"But we by a love so much refined,",renaissance_love
"   That our selves know not what it is,",renaissance_love
"Inter-assured of the mind,",renaissance_love
"   Care less, eyes, lips, and hands to miss.",renaissance_love
"Our two souls therefore, which are one,",renaissance_love
"   Though I must go, endure not yet",renaissance_love
"A breach, but an expansion,",renaissance_love
   Like gold to airy thinness beat.,renaissance_love
"If they be two, they are two so",renaissance_love
   As stiff twin compasses are two;,renaissance_love
"Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show",renaissance_love
"   To move, but doth, if the other do.",renaissance_love
"And though it in the center sit,",renaissance_love
"   Yet when the other far doth roam,",renaissance_love
"It leans and hearkens after it,",renaissance_love
"   And grows erect, as that comes home.",renaissance_love
"Such wilt thou be to me, who must,",renaissance_love
"   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;",renaissance_love
"Thy firmness makes my circle just,",renaissance_love
   And makes me end where I begun.,renaissance_love
   Let me pour forth,renaissance_love
"My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,",renaissance_love
"For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,",renaissance_love
"And by this mintage they are something worth,",renaissance_love
         For thus they be,renaissance_love
         Pregnant of thee;,renaissance_love
"Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,",renaissance_love
"When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,",renaissance_love
"So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.",renaissance_love
         On a round ball,renaissance_love
"A workman that hath copies by, can lay",renaissance_love
"An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,",renaissance_love
"And quickly make that, which was nothing, all;",renaissance_love
         So doth each tear,renaissance_love
"         Which thee doth wear,",renaissance_love
"A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,",renaissance_love
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow,renaissance_love
"This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.",renaissance_love
"         O more than moon,",renaissance_love
"Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,",renaissance_love
"Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear",renaissance_love
To teach the sea what it may do too soon;,renaissance_love
         Let not the wind,renaissance_love
"         Example find,",renaissance_love
To do me more harm than it purposeth;,renaissance_love
"Since thou and I sigh one another's breath,",renaissance_love
"Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's death.",renaissance_love
What needeth these threnning words and wasted wind?,renaissance_love

Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance_mythology_folklore

Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance_mythology_folklore
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance_mythology_folklore
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance_mythology_folklore
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For some good gentleman, that hath the right",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Unto his church for to present a wight,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That if the living yearly do arise,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"And he will care for all the rest to shift,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Both that the bishop may admit of thee,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Living to get, and not to be discern'd.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For learning sake to living them to raise;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven,renaissance_mythology_folklore
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Needs any more to learn to get a living?""",renaissance_mythology_folklore

And do not doubt but duly to incline,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So parted they, as either's way them led.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But, ere long time had passed, they so ill",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"How foully they their offices abus'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"So long persisted obstinate and bold,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till at the length he published to hold,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A visitation, and them cited thether:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then was high time their wits about to geather.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"What did they then, but made a composition",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
To whom their living they resigned quite,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For a few pence, and ran away by night.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When I whose sullen care,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Walked forth to ease my pain,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And crown their paramours,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As each had been a bride;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,renaissance_mythology_folklore
The tender stalks on high.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With store of vermeil roses,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Did never whiter shew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So purely white they were,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And mar their beauties bright,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That shone as heaven's light,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Their wondering eyes to fill.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
For sure they did not seem,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And all the waves did strew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The which presenting all in trim array,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Prepared against that day,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Of your love's complement:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For ever to assoil.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And blessed plenty wait upon your board,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Upon your bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So ended she; and all the rest around,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Their accents did resound.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Making his stream run slow.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",renaissance_mythology_folklore
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Did on those two attend,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And their best service lend,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against their wedding day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"At length they all to merry London came,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That to me gave this life's first native source;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Though from another place I take my name,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
An house of ancient fame.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till they decayed through pride:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of that great lord, which therein wont to dwell,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Descended to the river's open viewing,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
With a great train ensuing.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Above the rest were goodly to be seen,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Fit for so goodly stature;,renaissance_mythology_folklore

Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They two forth pacing to the river's side,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance_nature
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance_nature
And pictures in our eyes to get,renaissance_nature
         Was all our propagation.,renaissance_nature
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance_nature
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance_nature
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance_nature
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance_nature
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance_nature
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance_nature
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance_nature
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance_nature
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance_nature

"A single violet transplant,",renaissance_nature
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance_nature
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance_nature
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance_nature
When love with one another so,renaissance_nature
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance_nature
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance_nature
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance_nature

"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance_nature
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance_nature
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance_nature
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance_nature
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance_nature
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance_nature
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance_nature
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance_nature
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance_nature
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance_nature
"         T' affections, and to faculties,",renaissance_nature
"Which sense may reach and apprehend,",renaissance_nature

In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;,renaissance_nature
"And where store was stroyed with the flood,",renaissance_nature
Then well away! for she undone was clean.,renaissance_nature
Then was she fain to take instead of food,renaissance_nature

Is far more business than this world is worth.,renaissance_nature
I'he world is but a carcass; thou art fed,renaissance_nature

Weep but because they go not yet thy way.,renaissance_nature

Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,renaissance_nature
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",renaissance_nature
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",renaissance_nature
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",renaissance_nature
Walked forth to ease my pain,renaissance_nature
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",renaissance_nature
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",renaissance_nature
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",renaissance_nature
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",renaissance_nature
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",renaissance_nature
"And crown their paramours,",renaissance_nature
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance_nature

"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",renaissance_nature
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",renaissance_nature
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",renaissance_nature
As each had been a bride;,renaissance_nature
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",renaissance_nature
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",renaissance_nature
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",renaissance_nature
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,renaissance_nature
The tender stalks on high.,renaissance_nature
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",renaissance_nature
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",renaissance_nature
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",renaissance_nature
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",renaissance_nature
"With store of vermeil roses,",renaissance_nature
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,renaissance_nature
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_nature
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_nature
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",renaissance_nature
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,renaissance_nature
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,renaissance_nature
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",renaissance_nature
"Did never whiter shew,",renaissance_nature
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",renaissance_nature
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",renaissance_nature
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",renaissance_nature
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",renaissance_nature
"So purely white they were,",renaissance_nature
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",renaissance_nature
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",renaissance_nature
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",renaissance_nature
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",renaissance_nature
"And mar their beauties bright,",renaissance_nature
"That shone as heaven's light,",renaissance_nature
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_nature
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_nature
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",renaissance_nature
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",renaissance_nature
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,renaissance_nature
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",renaissance_nature
Their wondering eyes to fill.,renaissance_nature
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",renaissance_nature
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",renaissance_nature
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",renaissance_nature
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance_nature
For sure they did not seem,renaissance_nature
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance_nature
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance_nature
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance_nature
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance_nature
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance_nature
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance_nature
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_nature
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_nature
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance_nature
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance_nature
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance_nature
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance_nature
"And all the waves did strew,",renaissance_nature
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",renaissance_nature
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",renaissance_nature
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance_nature
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance_nature
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance_nature
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",renaissance_nature
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",renaissance_nature
"The which presenting all in trim array,",renaissance_nature
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",renaissance_nature
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",renaissance_nature
"Prepared against that day,",renaissance_nature

Joy may you have and gentle heart's content,renaissance_nature
Of your love's complement:,renaissance_nature
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",renaissance_nature
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",renaissance_nature
