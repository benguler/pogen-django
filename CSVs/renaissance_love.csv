From itself never turning.,renaissance_love
"Stella is sick, and in that sick-bed lies",renaissance_love

"And grace, sick too, such fine conclusions tries",renaissance_love
That sickness brags itself best graced to be.,renaissance_love
"    Beauty is sick, but sick in so fair guise",renaissance_love
That in that paleness beautys white we see;,renaissance_love

"That hue, whose force my heart still unto thraldom ties?",renaissance_love
"    Galen's adoptive sons, who by a beaten way",renaissance_love
"    Their judgements hackney on, the fault on sickness lay;",renaissance_love
But feeling proof makes me say they mistake it far:,renaissance_love
"    It is but love, which makes his paper perfect white",renaissance_love

"    But thou art gone, now that self-felt disgrace",renaissance_love
Doth make me most to wish thy comfort near.,renaissance_love
"    But here I do store of fair ladies meet,",renaissance_love
    Who may with charm of conversation sweet,renaissance_love
Make in my heavy mould new thoughts to grow:,renaissance_love

"Merry with him, and not think of his woe.",renaissance_love
"Stella, since thou so right a princess art",renaissance_love
"Of all the powers which life bestows on me,",renaissance_love
There ere by them aught undertaken be,renaissance_love
They first resort unto that sovereign part;,renaissance_love
"Sweet, for a while give respite to my heart,",renaissance_love
"Which pants as though it still should leap to thee,",renaissance_love
And on my thoughts give thy lieutenancy,renaissance_love
"To this great cause, which needs both use and art,",renaissance_love
"And as a queen, who from her presence sends",renaissance_love
"Whom she employs, dismiss from thee my wit,",renaissance_love
Till it have wrought what thy own will attends.,renaissance_love
On servants shame oft masters blame doth sit.,renaissance_love
"Oh let not fools in me thy works reprove,",renaissance_love

Upon whose breast a fiercer gripe doth tire,renaissance_love
"Than did on him who first stale down the fire,",renaissance_love
"While Love on me doth all his quiver spend,",renaissance_love

"If that be sin which doth the manners frame,",renaissance_love
"Well stayed with truth in word and faith of deed,",renaissance_love
"Ready of wit, and fearing naught but shame;",renaissance_love
If that be sin which in fixed hearts doth breed,renaissance_love
"A loathing of all loose unchastity,",renaissance_love
"Then love is sin, and let me sinful be.",renaissance_love
"Not at first sight, nor with a dribbed shot,",renaissance_love
   Love gave the wound which while I breathe will bleed:,renaissance_love
"   But known worth did in mine of time proceed,",renaissance_love
Till by degrees it had full conquest got.,renaissance_love
"I saw, and liked; I liked, but loved not;",renaissance_love
"   I loved, but straight did not what love decreed:",renaissance_love
"   At length to loves decrees I, forced, agreed,",renaissance_love
Yet with repining at so partial lot.,renaissance_love
   Now even that footstep of lost liberty,renaissance_love
"Is gone, and now like slave-born Muscovite",renaissance_love
I call it praise to suffer tyranny;,renaissance_love
And now employ the remnant of my wit,renaissance_love
"   To make myself believe that all is well,",renaissance_love
   While with a feeling skill I paint my hell.,renaissance_love
   Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame,renaissance_love

"By Phoebus doom, with sugared sentence says",renaissance_love
"That Virtue, if it once met with our eyes,",renaissance_love
Strange flames of love it in our souls would raise;,renaissance_love
"But, for that man with pain this truth descries,",renaissance_love
"While he each thing in senses balance weighs,",renaissance_love
And so nor will nor can behold those skies,renaissance_love
"Which inward sun to heroic mind displays,",renaissance_love
"Virtue of late, with virtuous care to stir",renaissance_love

That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feelst a lovers case:",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace,renaissance_love

Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love

    Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
    Do they call virtue thereungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"    What, have I thus betrayed my liberty?",renaissance_love
Can those black beams such burning marks engrave,renaissance_love
"In my free side? or am I born a slave,",renaissance_love
Whose neck becomes such yoke of tyranny?,renaissance_love
Or want I sense to feel my misery?,renaissance_love
"Or sprite, disdain of such disdain to have?",renaissance_love
"Who for long faith, though daily help I crave,",renaissance_love
May get no alms but scorn of beggary.,renaissance_love

"In humble lines the work of careful hours,",renaissance_love
The sacrifice I offer to her sight.,renaissance_love
"But since she scorns her own, this rests for me,",renaissance_love
"Ill moan my self, and hide the wrong I have:",renaissance_love
And so content me that her frowns should be,renaissance_love
"To my infant style the cradle, and the grave.",renaissance_love
"What though my self no honor get thereby,",renaissance_love
"Each bird sings therself, and so will I.",renaissance_love
A face that should content me wondrous well,renaissance_love
"Should not be fair but lovely to behold,",renaissance_love
With gladsome cheer all grief for to expel;,renaissance_love
With sober looks so would I that it should,renaissance_love
Speak without words such words as none can tell;,renaissance_love
Her tress also should be of crisped gold;,renaissance_love
"With wit; and thus might chance I might be tied,",renaissance_love
And knit again the knot that should not slide.,renaissance_love
In summers heat and mid-time of the day,renaissance_love
"To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,",renaissance_love

Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:,renaissance_love
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed,renaissance_love
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.,renaissance_love
"I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,",renaissance_love
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.,renaissance_love
"And striving thus as one that would be cast,",renaissance_love
"Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.",renaissance_love
"Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,",renaissance_love
Not one wen in her body could I spy.,renaissance_love
"What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,",renaissance_love
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?,renaissance_love
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?,renaissance_love
"How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?",renaissance_love
"To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,",renaissance_love
"I clinged her naked body, down she fell,",renaissance_love
"Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,",renaissance_love
Jove send me more such afternoons as this.,renaissance_love

"A way of error, a temple full of treason,",renaissance_love
In all effects contrary unto reason.,renaissance_love
"A poisoned serpent covered all with flowers,",renaissance_love
"Mother of sighs, and murderer of repose,",renaissance_love
A sea of sorrows whence are drawn such showers,renaissance_love
As moisture lend to every grief that grows;,renaissance_love
"A school of guile, a net of deep deceit,",renaissance_love
A gilded hook that holds a poisoned bait.,renaissance_love
"A fortress foiled, which reason did defend,",renaissance_love
"A siren song, a fever of the mind,",renaissance_love
"A maze wherein affection finds no end,",renaissance_love
"A raging cloud that runs before the wind,",renaissance_love
"A substance like the shadow of the sun,",renaissance_love
A goal of grief for which the wisest run.,renaissance_love
"A quenchless fire, a nurse of trembling fear,",renaissance_love
"A path that leads to peril and mishap,",renaissance_love
"A true retreat of sorrow and despair,",renaissance_love
"An idle boy that sleeps in pleasure's lap,",renaissance_love
"A deep mistrust of that which certain seems,",renaissance_love
A hope of that which reason doubtful deems.,renaissance_love
"Sith then thy trains my younger years betrayed,",renaissance_love
And for my faith ingratitude I find;,renaissance_love
"And sith repentance hath my wrongs bewrayed,",renaissance_love
Whose course was ever contrary to kind:,renaissance_love

Dead is the root whence all these fancies grew.,renaissance_love
"Mark but this flea, and mark in this,   ",renaissance_love
How little that which thou deniest me is;   ,renaissance_love
"It sucked me first, and now sucks thee,",renaissance_love
And in this flea our two bloods mingled be;   ,renaissance_love
Thou knowst that this cannot be said,renaissance_love
"A sin, nor shame, nor loss of maidenhead,",renaissance_love
"    Yet this enjoys before it woo,",renaissance_love
"    And pampered swells with one blood made of two,",renaissance_love
"    And this, alas, is more than we would do.",renaissance_love

"To see me hold my louring head so low,",renaissance_love
And that mine eyes take no delight to range,renaissance_love
About the gleams which on your face do grow.,renaissance_love
The mouse which once hath broken out of trap,renaissance_love
"Is seldom ticed with the trustless bait,",renaissance_love
"But lies aloof for fear of more mishap,",renaissance_love
And feedeth still in doubt of deep deceit.,renaissance_love
"The scorched fly, which once hath scaped the flame,",renaissance_love
"Will hardly come to play again with fire,",renaissance_love
Whereby I learn that grievous is the game,renaissance_love
Which follows fancy dazzled by desire:,renaissance_love

Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,renaissance_love
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,renaissance_love

Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.,renaissance_love
How much more praise deserved thy beautys use ,renaissance_love

When in eternal lines to time thou growst:,renaissance_love
"   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,",renaissance_love
"   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",renaissance_love
   A womans face with natures own hand painted,renaissance_love
"Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;",renaissance_love
"A womans gentle heart, but not acquainted",renaissance_love
With shifting change as is false womens fashion;,renaissance_love
"An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,",renaissance_love
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;,renaissance_love
"A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,",renaissance_love
Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth.,renaissance_love
"And for a woman wert thou first created,",renaissance_love
"Till nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,",renaissance_love
And by addition me of thee defeated,renaissance_love
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.,renaissance_love
"      But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,",renaissance_love
      Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure.,renaissance_love
      No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:,renaissance_love

"All men make faults, and even I in this,",renaissance_love
"Authorizing thy trespass with compare,",renaissance_love
"Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,",renaissance_love
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are:,renaissance_love
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense,renaissance_love
Thy adverse party is thy advocate,renaissance_love
And gainst myself a lawful plea commence.,renaissance_love
"Such civil war is in my love and hate,",renaissance_love
   That I an accessory needs must be,renaissance_love
   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.,renaissance_love
"   Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all:",renaissance_love
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?,renaissance_love
"No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call",renaissance_love
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.,renaissance_love
"Then if for my love thou my love receivest,",renaissance_love
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;,renaissance_love
But yet be blamed if thou this self deceivest,renaissance_love
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.,renaissance_love
"I do forgive thy robbry, gentle thief,",renaissance_love
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;,renaissance_love
And yet love knows it is a greater grief,renaissance_love
To bear loves wrong than hates known injury.,renaissance_love

"    Kill me with spites, yet we must not be foes.",renaissance_love
    Not marble nor the gilded monuments,renaissance_love

But you shall shine more bright in these contents,renaissance_love
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.,renaissance_love
"When wasteful war shall statues overturn,",renaissance_love
"And broils root out the work of masonry,",renaissance_love
Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn,renaissance_love
The living record of your memory.,renaissance_love
Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity,renaissance_love
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room,renaissance_love
Even in the eyes of all posterity,renaissance_love
That wear this world out to the ending doom.,renaissance_love
"    So, till the Judgement that yourself arise,",renaissance_love
"    You live in this, and dwell in lovers eyes.",renaissance_love
"    Being your slave, what should I do but tend",renaissance_love
Upon the hours and times of your desire?,renaissance_love
"I have no precious time at all to spend,",renaissance_love
"Nor services to do, till you require.",renaissance_love
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour,renaissance_love
"Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you.",renaissance_love
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour,renaissance_love
When you have bid your servant once adieu;,renaissance_love
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought,renaissance_love
"Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,",renaissance_love
"But like a sad slave, stay and think of nought,",renaissance_love
"Save, where you are how happy you make those.",renaissance_love
So true a fool is love that in your will,renaissance_love
"Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.",renaissance_love
"Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea",renaissance_love
"But sad mortality oer-sways their power,",renaissance_love
"How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,",renaissance_love
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?,renaissance_love
"O, how shall summers honey breath hold out",renaissance_love
"Against the wrackful siege of battring days,",renaissance_love
"When rocks impregnable are not so stout,",renaissance_love
"Nor gates of steel so strong, but time decays?",renaissance_love
"O fearful meditation! where, alack,",renaissance_love
Shall times best jewel from times chest lie hid?,renaissance_love
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?,renaissance_love
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?,renaissance_love
"   O, none, unless this miracle have might,",renaissance_love
   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.,renaissance_love
"   Why is my verse so barren of new pride,",renaissance_love
So far from variation or quick change?,renaissance_love
Why with the time do I not glance aside,renaissance_love
"To new-found methods, and to compounds strange?",renaissance_love
"Why write I still all one, ever the same,",renaissance_love
"And keep invention in a noted weed,",renaissance_love
"That every word doth almost tell my name,",renaissance_love
"Showing their birth, and where they did proceed?",renaissance_love
"O know, sweet love, I always write of you,",renaissance_love
"And you and love are still my argument,",renaissance_love
"So all my best is dressing old words new,",renaissance_love
Spending again what is already spent:,renaissance_love
"   For as the sun is daily new and old,",renaissance_love
   So is my love still telling what is told.,renaissance_love
"   Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,",renaissance_love
And like enough thou knowst thy estimate.,renaissance_love
The Charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;,renaissance_love
My bonds in thee are all determinate.,renaissance_love
"For how do I hold thee but by thy granting,",renaissance_love
And for that riches where is my deserving?,renaissance_love
"The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,",renaissance_love
And so my patent back again is swerving.,renaissance_love
"Thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing,",renaissance_love
"Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking,",renaissance_love
"So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,",renaissance_love
"Comes home again, on better judgement making.",renaissance_love
   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter:,renaissance_love
"   In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.",renaissance_love
"   From you have I been absent in the spring,",renaissance_love
"When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,",renaissance_love
"Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,",renaissance_love
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.,renaissance_love
"Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell",renaissance_love
"Of different flowers in odour and in hue,",renaissance_love
"Could make me any summers story tell,",renaissance_love
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:,renaissance_love
"Nor did I wonder at the lilys white,",renaissance_love
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;,renaissance_love
"They were but sweet, but figures of delight",renaissance_love
"Drawn after you,  you pattern of all those.",renaissance_love
"    Yet seemd it winter still, and, you away,",renaissance_love
    As with your shadow I with these did play.,renaissance_love
"    To me, fair friend, you never can be old,",renaissance_love
"For as you were when first your eye I eyed,",renaissance_love
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,renaissance_love
"Have from the forests shook three summers pride,",renaissance_love
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned,renaissance_love
"In process of the seasons have I seen,",renaissance_love
"Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned,",renaissance_love
"Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.",renaissance_love
"Ah, yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,",renaissance_love
"Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;",renaissance_love
"So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,",renaissance_love
"Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived:",renaissance_love
"For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred:",renaissance_love
Ere you were born was beautys summer dead.,renaissance_love
"O! never say that I was false of heart,",renaissance_love
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.,renaissance_love
As easy might I from myself depart,renaissance_love
"As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:",renaissance_love
"That is my home of love; if I have ranged,",renaissance_love
"Like him that travels, I return again,",renaissance_love
"Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,",renaissance_love
So that myself bring water for my stain.,renaissance_love
"Never believe, though in my nature reigned",renaissance_love
"All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,",renaissance_love
"That it could so preposterously be stained,",renaissance_love
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;,renaissance_love
"   For nothing this wide universe I call,",renaissance_love
"   Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.",renaissance_love
"   O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy powr",renaissance_love
"Dost hold times fickle glass his sickle hour,",renaissance_love
"Who hast by waning grown, and therein showst",renaissance_love
"Thy lovers withering, as thy sweet self growst",renaissance_love
"In nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,",renaissance_love
"As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back,",renaissance_love
"She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill",renaissance_love
"May time disgrace, and wretched minute kill.",renaissance_love
"Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure;",renaissance_love
She may detain but not still keep her treasure.,renaissance_love
"   Her audit, though delayed, answered must be,",renaissance_love
   And her quietus is to render thee.,renaissance_love
"   Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy Will,",renaissance_love
"And Will to boot, and Will in overplus;",renaissance_love
"More than enough am I that vex thee still,",renaissance_love
To thy sweet will making addition thus.,renaissance_love
"Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,",renaissance_love
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?,renaissance_love
"Shall will in others seem right gracious,",renaissance_love
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?,renaissance_love
"The sea, all water, yet receives rain still,",renaissance_love
And in abundance addeth to his store;,renaissance_love
So thou being rich in Will add to thy Will,renaissance_love
"One will of mine, to make thy large Will more.",renaissance_love
"   Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;",renaissance_love
"   Think all but one, and me in that one Will.",renaissance_love
"   When my love swears that she is made of truth,",renaissance_love
"I do believe her, though I know she lies,",renaissance_love
"That she might think me some untutored youth,",renaissance_love
Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties.,renaissance_love
"Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,",renaissance_love
"Although she knows my days are past the best,",renaissance_love
Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:,renaissance_love
On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed.,renaissance_love
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?,renaissance_love
And wherefore say not I that I am old?,renaissance_love
"Oh, loves best habit is in seeming trust,",renaissance_love
And age in love loves not to have years told.,renaissance_love
"    Therefore I lie with her and she with me,",renaissance_love
    And in our faults by lies we flattered be.,renaissance_love
"    In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",renaissance_love
For they in thee a thousand errors note;,renaissance_love
"But tis my heart that loves what they despise,",renaissance_love
"Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",renaissance_love
"Nor are mine ears with thy tongues tune delighted,",renaissance_love
"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",renaissance_love
"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",renaissance_love
To any sensual feast with thee alone:,renaissance_love
But my five wits nor my five senses can,renaissance_love
"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",renaissance_love
"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",renaissance_love
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be.,renaissance_love
"   Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",renaissance_love
   That she that makes me sin awards me pain.,renaissance_love
"   Two loves I have of comfort and despair,",renaissance_love
Which like two spirits do suggest me still,renaissance_love
"The better angel is a man right fair,",renaissance_love
The worser spirit a woman coloured ill.,renaissance_love
"To win me soon to hell, my female evil",renaissance_love
"Tempteth my better angel from my side,",renaissance_love
"And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,",renaissance_love
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.,renaissance_love
"And, whether that my angel be turnd fiend,",renaissance_love
"Suspect I may, yet not directly tell,",renaissance_love
"But being both from me both to each friend,",renaissance_love
I guess one angel in anothers hell.,renaissance_love
"   Yet this shall I neer know, but live in doubt,",renaissance_love
   Till my bad angel fire my good one out.,renaissance_love
"   I that have been a lover, and could show it,",renaissance_love
"Though not in these, in rithmes not wholly dumb,",renaissance_love
"Since I exscribe your sonnets, am become",renaissance_love
"A better lover, and much better poet.",renaissance_love
Nor is my Muse or I ashamed to owe it,renaissance_love
"To those true numerous graces, whereof some",renaissance_love
"But charm the senses, others overcome",renaissance_love
Both brains and hearts; and mine now best do know it:,renaissance_love
"For in your verse all Cupids armory,",renaissance_love
"His flames, his shafts, his quiver, and his bow,",renaissance_love
His very eyes are yours to overthrow.,renaissance_love
"But then his mothers sweets you so apply,",renaissance_love
"Her joys, her smiles, her loves, as readers take",renaissance_love
For Venus ceston every line you make.,renaissance_love
"Take, oh, take those lips away",renaissance_love
That so sweetly were forsworn,renaissance_love
"And those eyes, like break of day,",renaissance_love
Lights that do mislead the morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, though sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Hide, oh, hide those hills of snow,",renaissance_love
"Which thy frozen bosom bears,",renaissance_love
On whose tops the pinks that grow,renaissance_love
Are of those that April wears;,renaissance_love
"But first set my poor heart free,",renaissance_love
Bound in those icy chains by thee.,renaissance_love
"Though I am young, and cannot tell",renaissance_love
"    Either what Death or Love is well,",renaissance_love
"Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",renaissance_love
    And both do aim at human hearts.,renaissance_love
"And then again, I have been told",renaissance_love
"    Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",renaissance_love
So that I fear they do but bring,renaissance_love
"    Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",renaissance_love
As in a ruin we it call,renaissance_love
"    One thing to be blown up, or fall;",renaissance_love
Or to our end like way may have,renaissance_love
"    By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",renaissance_love
So Loves inflamed shaft or brand,renaissance_love
    May kill as soon as Deaths cold hand;,renaissance_love
Except Loves fires the virtue have,renaissance_love
    To fright the frost out of the grave.,renaissance_love
"    Though that men do call it dotage,",renaissance_love
Who loveth not wanteth courage;,renaissance_love
"And whosoever may love get,",renaissance_love
From Venus sure he must it fet,renaissance_love
"Or else from her which is her heir,",renaissance_love
And she to him must seem most fair.,renaissance_love
With eye and mind doth both agree.,renaissance_love
There is no boot: there must it be.,renaissance_love
"The eye doth look and represent,",renaissance_love
But mind afformeth with full consent.,renaissance_love
Thus am I fixed without grudge:,renaissance_love
Mine eye with heart doth me so judge.,renaissance_love
Love maintaineth all noble courage.,renaissance_love
Who love disdaineth is all of the village:,renaissance_love
Such loversthough they take pain,renaissance_love
"It were pity they should obtain,",renaissance_love
For often times where they do sue,renaissance_love
They hinder lovers that would be true.,renaissance_love
For whoso loveth should love but once.,renaissance_love
"Change whoso will, I will be none.",renaissance_love
"Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,",renaissance_love
"Until I labour, I in labour lie.",renaissance_love
"The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,",renaissance_love
Is tird with standing though he never fight.,renaissance_love
"Off with that girdle, like heavens Zone glistering,",renaissance_love
But a far fairer world encompassing.,renaissance_love
"Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,",renaissance_love
That theyes of busy fools may be stopped there.,renaissance_love
"Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,",renaissance_love
"Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.",renaissance_love
"Off with that happy busk, which I envy,",renaissance_love
"That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.",renaissance_love
"Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,",renaissance_love
As when from flowery meads thhills shadow steals.,renaissance_love
Off with that wiry Coronet and shew,renaissance_love
The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:,renaissance_love
"Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread",renaissance_love
"In this loves hallowd temple, this soft bed.",renaissance_love
"In such white robes, heavens Angels used to be",renaissance_love
Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee,renaissance_love
A heaven like Mahomets Paradise; and though,renaissance_love
"Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,",renaissance_love
"By this these Angels from an evil sprite,",renaissance_love
"Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.",renaissance_love
"    Licence my roving hands, and let them go,",renaissance_love

All suddenly I saw the Fairy Queen;,renaissance_love

How shall I know your true love,renaissance_love
That have met many one,renaissance_love
As I went to the holy land,renaissance_love

Know that love is a careless child,renaissance_love
"And forgets promise past,",renaissance_love
"He is blind, he is deaf when he list",renaissance_love
And in faith never fast.,renaissance_love
His desire is a dureless content,renaissance_love
And a trustless joy,renaissance_love
He is won with a world of despair,renaissance_love
And is lost with a toy.,renaissance_love
Of womenkind such indeed is the love,renaissance_love

"Go, go, go, seek some other where; importune me no more.",renaissance_love
"How many weeping eyes I made to pine in woe,",renaissance_love

"When to her lute Corinna sings,",renaissance_love
"Her voice revives the leaden strings,",renaissance_love
And doth in highest notes appear,renaissance_love
As any challenged echo clear;,renaissance_love
"But when she doth of mourning speak,",renaissance_love
Evn with her sighs the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"And as her lute doth live or die,",renaissance_love
"Let by her passion, so must I:",renaissance_love
"For when of pleasure she doth sing,",renaissance_love
"My thoughts enjoy a sudden spring,",renaissance_love
"But if she doth of sorrow speak,",renaissance_love
Evn from my heart the strings do break.,renaissance_love
"Now thou has loved me one whole day,",renaissance_love
"Tomorrow when you leavst, what wilt thou say?",renaissance_love
Wilt thou then antedate some new-made vow?,renaissance_love
            Or say that now,renaissance_love
We are not just those persons which we were?,renaissance_love
"Or, that oaths made in reverential fear",renaissance_love

"Womanhood, wanton, ye want:",renaissance_love
"Your meddling, mistress, is mannerless;",renaissance_love
"Plenty of ill, of goodness scant,",renaissance_love
"Ye rail at riot, reckless:",renaissance_love
To praise your port it is needless;,renaissance_love
"For all your draff yet and your dregs,",renaissance_love
As well borne as ye full oft time begs.,renaissance_love
Why so coy and full of scorn?,renaissance_love
"Mine horse is sold, I ween, you say;",renaissance_love
"My new furred gown, when it is worn...",renaissance_love
"Put up your purse, ye shall not pay!",renaissance_love
"By crede, I trust to see the day,",renaissance_love
"As proud a pea-hen as ye spread,",renaissance_love
Of me and other ye may have need!,renaissance_love
"Though angelic be your smiling,",renaissance_love
"Yet is your tongue an adders tail,",renaissance_love
Full like a scorpion stinging,renaissance_love
All those by whom ye have avail.,renaissance_love

"What prate ye, pretty pigesnye?",renaissance_love
I trust to quite you ere I die!,renaissance_love

That wones at The Key in Thames Street.,renaissance_love

"Whose heavenly gifts increased by disdain,",renaissance_love
And virtue sank the deeper in his breast;,renaissance_love
Such profit he of envy could obtain.,renaissance_love
"A head, where wisdom mysteries did frame,",renaissance_love
Whose hammers beat still in that lively brain,renaissance_love
"As on a stith, where some work of fame",renaissance_love
"Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.",renaissance_love
"A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,",renaissance_love
"Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;",renaissance_love
"Amid great storms whom grace assured so,",renaissance_love
To live upright and smile at fortunes choice.,renaissance_love
A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;,renaissance_love
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;,renaissance_love
"A mark the which (unperfited, for time)",renaissance_love
"Some may approach, but never none shall hit.",renaissance_love
A tongue that served in foreign realms his king;,renaissance_love
Whose courteous talk to virtue did enflame,renaissance_love
Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring,renaissance_love
"Our English youth, by travail unto fame.",renaissance_love
"An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,",renaissance_love

"         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,",renaissance_love
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.,renaissance_love

"That it assume thy body, I allow,",renaissance_love
"And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.",renaissance_love
"Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,",renaissance_love
"And so more steadily to have gone,",renaissance_love

"'Twixt women's love, and men's, will ever be.",renaissance_love

At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.,renaissance_love

It stopped is with thought's astonishment:,renaissance_love
"And when my pen would write her titles true,",renaissance_love
It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:,renaissance_love
Yet in my heart I then both speak and write,renaissance_love
The wonder that my wit cannot endite.,renaissance_love

"The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,",renaissance_love
Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.,renaissance_love
"There she beholding me with milder look,",renaissance_love
"Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:",renaissance_love
"Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,",renaissance_love
And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.,renaissance_love
"Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,",renaissance_love
"So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd.",renaissance_love
"Most happy letters, fram'd by skilful trade,",renaissance_love
With which that happy name was first design'd:,renaissance_love

That three such graces did unto me give.,renaissance_love
"Men call you fair, and you do credit it,",renaissance_love
For that your self ye daily such do see:,renaissance_love
"But the true fair, that is the gentle wit,",renaissance_love
"And vertuous mind, is much more prais'd of me.",renaissance_love
"For all the rest, how ever fair it be,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to naught and lose that glorious hue:,renaissance_love
But only that is permanent and free,renaissance_love
"From frail corruption, that doth flesh ensue.",renaissance_love

"Mother of love, and of all world's delight,",renaissance_love
Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty,renaissance_love

Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light,renaissance_love
"T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne,",renaissance_love
And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:,renaissance_love

"Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost,",renaissance_love
"That now it wasted is with woes extreme,",renaissance_love
"It may so please, that she at length will stream",renaissance_love
"Some dew of grace into my withered heart,",renaissance_love
After long sorrow and consuming smart.,renaissance_love
WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast,renaissance_love
"To make all things such as we now behold,",renaissance_love

Thereof as every earthly thing partakes,renaissance_love
"Or more or less, by influence divine,",renaissance_love
"So it more fair accordingly it makes,",renaissance_love
"And the gross matter of this earthly mine,",renaissance_love
"Which clotheth it, thereafter doth refine,",renaissance_love
Doing away the dross which dims the light,renaissance_love
Of that fair beam which therein is empight.,renaissance_love
"For, through infusion of celestial power,",renaissance_love
"The duller earth it quick'neth with delight,",renaissance_love
And lifeful spirits privily doth pour,renaissance_love
"Through all the parts, that to the looker's sight",renaissance_love
"They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might,",renaissance_love
"O Cyprian queen, which flowing from the beam",renaissance_love
"Of thy bright star, thou into them dost stream.",renaissance_love
That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace,renaissance_love
"To all things fair, that kindleth lively fire,",renaissance_love

"Thence to the soul darts amorous desire,",renaissance_love
And robs the hearts of those which it admire;,renaissance_love
"Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow,",renaissance_love

Or that it is but comely composition,renaissance_love
"Of parts well measur'd, with meet disposition.",renaissance_love
"Hath white and red in it such wondrous power,",renaissance_love
"That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart,",renaissance_love
"And therein stir such rage and restless stour,",renaissance_love
As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?,renaissance_love
Or can proportion of the outward part,renaissance_love
"Move such affection in the inward mind,",renaissance_love
That it can rob both sense and reason blind?,renaissance_love
"Why do not then the blossoms of the field,",renaissance_love
"Which are array'd with much more orient hue,",renaissance_love
"And to the sense most dainty odours yield,",renaissance_love
Work like impression in the looker's view?,renaissance_love
"Or why do not fair pictures like power shew,",renaissance_love
In which oft-times we nature see of art,renaissance_love
"Excell'd, in perfect limning every part?",renaissance_love
"But ah, believe me, there is more than so,",renaissance_love
That works such wonders in the minds of men;,renaissance_love
"I, that have often prov'd, too well it know,",renaissance_love
"And whoso list the like assays to ken,",renaissance_love
"Shall find by trial, and confess it then,",renaissance_love
"That beauty is not, as fond men misdeem,",renaissance_love
"An outward shew of things, that only seem.",renaissance_love
"For that same goodly hue of white and red,",renaissance_love
"With which the cheeks are sprinkled, shall decay,",renaissance_love
"And those sweet rosy leaves, so fairly spread",renaissance_love
"Upon the lips, shall fade and fall away",renaissance_love
"To that they were, even to corrupted clay;",renaissance_love
"That golden wire, those sparkling stars so bright,",renaissance_love
Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.,renaissance_love
"But that fair lamp, from whose celestial ray",renaissance_love
"That light proceeds, which kindleth lovers' fire,",renaissance_love
Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;,renaissance_love
"But when the vital spirits do expire,",renaissance_love
Unto her native planet shall retire;,renaissance_love
"For it is heavenly born and cannot die,",renaissance_love
Being a parcel of the purest sky.,renaissance_love
"For when the soul, the which derived was,",renaissance_love
"At first, out of that great immortal Spright,",renaissance_love
"By whom all live to love, whilom did pass",renaissance_love
Down from the top of purest heaven's height,renaissance_love
"To be embodied here, it then took light",renaissance_love
"And lively spirits from that fairest star,",renaissance_love
Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.,renaissance_love
"Which power retaining still or more or less,",renaissance_love
"When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced,",renaissance_love
"Through every part she doth the same impress,",renaissance_love
"According as the heavens have her graced,",renaissance_love
"And frames her house, in which she will be placed,",renaissance_love
"Fit for herself, adorning it with spoil",renaissance_love
Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.,renaissance_love
"Thereof it comes that these fair souls, which have",renaissance_love
"The most resemblance of that heavenly light,",renaissance_love
Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave,renaissance_love
"Their fleshly bower, most fit for their delight,",renaissance_love
And the gross matter by a sovereign might,renaissance_love
"Tempers so trim, that it may well be seen",renaissance_love
A palace fit for such a virgin queen.,renaissance_love
"So every spirit, as it is most pure,",renaissance_love
"And hath in it the more of heavenly light,",renaissance_love
So it the fairer body doth procure,renaissance_love
"To habit in, and it more fairly dight",renaissance_love
With cheerful grace and amiable sight.,renaissance_love
For of the soul the body form doth take:,renaissance_love
"For soul is form, and doth the body make.",renaissance_love
Therefore wherever that thou dost behold,renaissance_love
"A comely corpse, with beauty fair endued,",renaissance_love
"Know this for certain, that the same doth hold",renaissance_love
"A beauteous soul, with fair conditions thewed,",renaissance_love
Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.,renaissance_love
"For all that fair is, is by nature good;",renaissance_love
That is a sign to know the gentle blood.,renaissance_love
Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind,renaissance_love
"Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd,",renaissance_love
"Either by chance, against the course of kind,",renaissance_love
"Or through unaptness in the substance found,",renaissance_love
"Which it assumed of some stubborn ground,",renaissance_love
"That will not yield unto her form's direction,",renaissance_love
But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.,renaissance_love
"And oft it falls, (ay me, the more to rue)",renaissance_love
"That goodly beauty, albe heavenly born,",renaissance_love
"Is foul abus'd, and that celestial hue,",renaissance_love
"Which doth the world with her delight adorn,",renaissance_love
"Made but the bait of sin, and sinners' scorn,",renaissance_love
"Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it,",renaissance_love
But every one doth seek but to deprave it.,renaissance_love
"Yet nathemore is that fair beauty's blame,",renaissance_love
But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:,renaissance_love
"Nothing so good, but that through guilty shame",renaissance_love
"May be corrupt, and wrested unto will:",renaissance_love
"Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still,",renaissance_love
"However flesh{""e}s fault it filthy make;",renaissance_love
For things immortal no corruption take.,renaissance_love
"But ye fair dames, the world's dear ornaments",renaissance_love
"And lively images of heaven's light,",renaissance_love
Let not your beams with such disparagements,renaissance_love
"Be dimm'd, and your bright glory dark'ned quite;",renaissance_love
"But mindful still of your first country's sight,",renaissance_love
"Do still preserve your first informed grace,",renaissance_love
Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.,renaissance_love
"Loathe that foul blot, that hellish firebrand,",renaissance_love
"Disloyal lust, fair beauty's foulest blame,",renaissance_love
"That base affections, which your ears would bland,",renaissance_love
"Commend to you by love's abused name,",renaissance_love
But is indeed the bondslave of defame;,renaissance_love
"Which will the garland of your glory mar,",renaissance_love
And quench the light of your bright shining star.,renaissance_love
"But gentle Love, that loyal is and true,",renaissance_love
"Will more illumine your resplendent ray,",renaissance_love
"And add more brightness to your goodly hue,",renaissance_love
"From light of his pure fire; which, by like way",renaissance_love
"Kindled of yours, your likeness doth display;",renaissance_love
"Like as two mirrors, by oppos'd reflection,",renaissance_love
Do both express the face's first impression.,renaissance_love
"Therefore, to make your beauty more appear,",renaissance_love
"It you behoves to love, and forth to lay",renaissance_love
"That heavenly riches which in you ye bear,",renaissance_love
That men the more admire their fountain may;,renaissance_love
"For else what booteth that celestial ray,",renaissance_love
"If it in darkness be enshrined ever,",renaissance_love
That it of loving eyes be viewed never?,renaissance_love
"But, in your choice of loves, this well advise,",renaissance_love
"That likest to yourselves ye them select,",renaissance_love
"The which your forms' first source may sympathize,",renaissance_love
And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;,renaissance_love
"For, if you loosely love without respect,",renaissance_love
"It is no love, but a discordant war,",renaissance_love
Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.,renaissance_love
For love is a celestial harmony,renaissance_love
"Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent,",renaissance_love
"Which join together in sweet sympathy,",renaissance_love
"To work each other's joy and true content,",renaissance_love
Which they have harbour'd since their first descent,renaissance_love
"Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see",renaissance_love
And know each other here belov'd to be.,renaissance_love
Then wrong it were that any other twain,renaissance_love
Should in love's gentle band combined be,renaissance_love
"But those whom Heaven did at first ordain,",renaissance_love
And made out of one mould the more t' agree;,renaissance_love
"For all that like the beauty which they see,",renaissance_love
Straight do not love; for love is not so light,renaissance_love
As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.,renaissance_love
"But they, which love indeed, look otherwise,",renaissance_love
"With pure regard and spotless true intent,",renaissance_love
Drawing out of the object of their eyes,renaissance_love
"A more refined form, which they present",renaissance_love
"Unto their mind, void of all blemishment;",renaissance_love
"Which it reducing to her first perfection,",renaissance_love
Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.,renaissance_love
"And then conforming it unto the light,",renaissance_love
"Which in itself it hath remaining still,",renaissance_love
"Of that first Sun, yet sparkling in his sight,",renaissance_love
Thereof he fashions in his higher skill,renaissance_love
An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;,renaissance_love
"And it embracing in his mind entire,",renaissance_love
The mirror of his own thought doth admire.,renaissance_love
"Which seeing now so inly fair to be,",renaissance_love
"As outward it appeareth to the eye,",renaissance_love
"And with his spirit's proportion to agree,",renaissance_love
"He thereon fixeth all his fantasy,",renaissance_love
And fully setteth his felicity;,renaissance_love
"Counting it fairer than it is indeed,",renaissance_love
And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.,renaissance_love
For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be,renaissance_love
"Than other men's, and in dear love's delight",renaissance_love
"See more than any other eyes can see,",renaissance_love
"Through mutual receipt of beam{""e}s bright,",renaissance_love
"Which carry privy message to the spright,",renaissance_love
"And to their eyes that inmost fair display,",renaissance_love
As plain as light discovers dawning day.,renaissance_love
"Therein they see, through amorous eye-glances,",renaissance_love
"Armies of loves still flying to and fro,",renaissance_love
Which dart at them their little fiery lances;,renaissance_love
"Whom having wounded, back again they go,",renaissance_love
Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;,renaissance_love
"Who, seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect,",renaissance_love
Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.,renaissance_love
In which how many wonders do they rede,renaissance_love
"To their conceit, that others never see,",renaissance_love
"Now of her smiles, with which their souls they feed,",renaissance_love
Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;,renaissance_love
"Now of her looks, which like to cordials be;",renaissance_love
"But when her words' embassade forth she sends,",renaissance_love
"Lord, how sweet music that unto them lends.",renaissance_love
Sometimes upon her forehead they behold,renaissance_love
A thousand graces masking in delight;,renaissance_love
Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold,renaissance_love
"Ten thousand sweet belgards, which to their sight",renaissance_love
Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;,renaissance_love
"But on her lips, like rosy buds in May,",renaissance_love
So many millions of chaste pleasures play.,renaissance_love
"All those, O Cytherea, and thousands more",renaissance_love
"Thy handmaids be, which do on thee attend,",renaissance_love
"To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store,",renaissance_love
"That may it more to mortal eyes commend,",renaissance_love
And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:,renaissance_love
"That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install,",renaissance_love
And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.,renaissance_love
"Then Io, triumph! O great Beauty's Queen,",renaissance_love
"Advance the banner of thy conquest high,",renaissance_love
"That all this world, the which thy vassals bene,",renaissance_love
"May draw to thee, and with due fealty",renaissance_love
"Adore the power of thy great majesty,",renaissance_love
"Singing this hymn in honour of thy name,",renaissance_love
"Compil'd by me, which thy poor liegeman am.",renaissance_love
"In lieu whereof grant, O great sovereign,",renaissance_love
That she whose conquering beauty doth captive,renaissance_love
"My trembling heart in her eternal chain,",renaissance_love
"One drop of grace at length will to me give,",renaissance_love
"That I her bounden thrall by her may live,",renaissance_love
"And this same life, which first fro me she reaved,",renaissance_love
"May owe to her, of whom I it received.",renaissance_love
"And you, fair Venus' darling, my dear dread,",renaissance_love
"Fresh flower of grace, great goddess of my life,",renaissance_love
"When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read,",renaissance_love
"Deign to let fall one drop of due relief,",renaissance_love
"That may recure my heart's long pining grief,",renaissance_love
"And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath,",renaissance_love
That can restore a damned wight from death.,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay, for shame,",renaissance_love
To save thee from the blame,renaissance_love
Of all my grief and grame;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath loved thee so long,renaissance_love
In wealth and woe among?,renaissance_love
And is thy heart so strong,renaissance_love
As for to leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
"And wilt thou leave me thus,",renaissance_love
That hath given thee my heart,renaissance_love
"Never for to depart,",renaissance_love
Nother for pain nor smart;,renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus,renaissance_love
And have no more pity,renaissance_love
Of him that loveth thee?,renaissance_love
"Helas, thy cruelty!",renaissance_love
And wilt thou leave me thus?,renaissance_love
"Say nay, say nay!Loving in truth, and fain in verse my love to show,",renaissance_love
"That she, dear she, might take some pleasure of my pain,",renaissance_love
"Pleasure might cause her read, reading might make her know,",renaissance_love
"Knowledge might pity win, and pity grace obtain,",renaissance_love
I sought fit words to paint the blackest face of woe;,renaissance_love
"Studying inventions fine her wits to entertain,",renaissance_love
"Oft turning others' leaves, to see if thence would flow",renaissance_love
Some fresh and fruitful showers upon my sunburn'd brain.,renaissance_love
"But words came halting forth, wanting invention's stay;",renaissance_love
"Invention, Nature's child, fled step-dame Study's blows;",renaissance_love
And others' feet still seem'd but strangers in my way.,renaissance_love
"Thus great with child to speak and helpless in my throes,",renaissance_love
"Biting my truant pen, beating myself for spite,",renaissance_love
"Fool, said my Muse to me, ""look in thy heart, and write.""",renaissance_love
You that do search for every purling spring,renaissance_love
"Which from the ribs of old Parnassus flows,",renaissance_love
"And every flower, not sweet perhaps, which grows",renaissance_love
"Near thereabouts, into your poesy wring;",renaissance_love
Ye that do dictionary's method bring,renaissance_love
"Into your rimes, running in rattling rows;",renaissance_love
You that poor Petrarch's long-deceased woes,renaissance_love
With new-born sighs and denizen'd wit do sing:,renaissance_love
You take wrong ways; those far-fet helps be such,renaissance_love
"As do bewray a want of inward touch,",renaissance_love
"And sure, at length stol'n goods do come to light.",renaissance_love
"But if, both for your love and skill, your name",renaissance_love
"You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame,",renaissance_love
"Stella behold, and then begin to endite.",renaissance_love
"Fly, fly, my friends, I have my death wound, fly!",renaissance_love
"See there that boy, that murd'ring boy, I say,",renaissance_love
"Who, like a thief, hid in dark bush doth lie",renaissance_love
Till bloody bullet get him wrongful prey.,renaissance_love
"So tyrant he no fitter place could spy,",renaissance_love
"Nor so fair level in so secret stay,",renaissance_love
As that sweet black which veils the heav'nly eye;,renaissance_love
There himself with his shot he close doth lay.,renaissance_love
"Poor passenger, pass now thereby I did,",renaissance_love
"And stay'd, pleas'd with the prospect of the place,",renaissance_love
While that black hue from me the bad guest hid;,renaissance_love
But straight I saw motions of lightning grace,renaissance_love
And then descried the glist'ring of his dart:,renaissance_love
But ere I could fly thence it pierc'd my heart.,renaissance_love
"The curious wits, seeing dull pensiveness",renaissance_love
"Bewray itself in my long-settl'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"Whence those same fumes of melancholy rise,",renaissance_love
With idle pains and missing aim do guess.,renaissance_love
"Some, that know how my spring I did address,",renaissance_love
Deem that my Muse some fruit of knowledge plies;,renaissance_love
"Others, because the prince my service tries,",renaissance_love
Think that I think state errors to redress;,renaissance_love
But harder judges judge ambition's ragei,renaissance_love
"Scourge of itself, still climbing slipp'ry placei",renaissance_love
Holds my young brain captiv'd in golden cage.,renaissance_love
"O fool or over-wise! alas, the race",renaissance_love
Of all my thoughts hath neither stop nor start,renaissance_love
But only Stella's eyes and Stella's heart.,renaissance_love
"Let dainty wits cry on the sisters nine,",renaissance_love
"That, bravely mask'd, their fancies may be told;",renaissance_love
"Or, Pindar's apes, flaunt they in phrases fine,",renaissance_love
Enam'ling with pied flowers their thoughts of gold.,renaissance_love
"Or else let them in statelier glory shine,",renaissance_love
Ennobling newfound tropes with problems old;,renaissance_love
"Or with strange similes enrich each line,",renaissance_love
Of herbs or beasts which Ind or Afric hold.,renaissance_love
"For me, in sooth, no Muse but one I know;",renaissance_love
"Phrases and problems from my reach do grow,",renaissance_love
And strange things cost too dear for my poor sprites.,renaissance_love
How then? even thus: in Stella's face I read,renaissance_love
What love and beauty be; then all my deed,renaissance_love
"But copying is, what in her Nature writes.",renaissance_love
"With how sad steps, O Moon, thou climb'st the skies!",renaissance_love
"How silently, and with how wan a face!",renaissance_love
"What, may it be that even in heav'nly place",renaissance_love
That busy archer his sharp arrows tries!,renaissance_love
"Sure, if that long-with love-acquainted eyes",renaissance_love
"Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case,",renaissance_love
I read it in thy looks; thy languish'd grace,renaissance_love
"To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.",renaissance_love
"Then, ev'n of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,",renaissance_love
Is constant love deem'd there but want of wit?,renaissance_love
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?,renaissance_love
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",renaissance_love
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?,renaissance_love
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?,renaissance_love
"I might!unhappy wordO me, I might,",renaissance_love
"And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;",renaissance_love
"Till now wrapt in a most infernal night,",renaissance_love
"I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.",renaissance_love
"Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;",renaissance_love
"No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,",renaissance_love
"No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,",renaissance_love
Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;,renaissance_love
"But to myself myself did give the blow,",renaissance_love
"While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me",renaissance_love
That I respects for both our sakes must show:,renaissance_love
And yet could not by rising morn foresee,renaissance_love
"How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,",renaissance_love
"That I had been more foolish,or more wise!Come Sleep! O Sleep, the certain knot of peace,",renaissance_love
"The baiting-place of wit, the balm of woe,",renaissance_love
"The poor man's wealth, the prisoner's release,",renaissance_love
Th' indifferent judge between the high and low.,renaissance_love
With shield of proof shield me from out the prease,renaissance_love
Of those fierce darts despair at me doth throw:,renaissance_love
O make in me those civil wars to cease;,renaissance_love
"I will good tribute pay, if thou do so.",renaissance_love
"Take thou of me smooth pillows, sweetest bed,",renaissance_love
"A chamber deaf to noise and blind to light,",renaissance_love
A rosy garland and a weary head:,renaissance_love
"And if these things, as being thine by right,",renaissance_love
"Move not thy heavy grace, thou shalt in me,",renaissance_love
"Livelier than elsewhere, Stella's image see.",renaissance_love
"Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance",renaissance_love
"Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,",renaissance_love
Both by the judgment of the English eyes,renaissance_love
And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;,renaissance_love
"Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,",renaissance_love
Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies,renaissance_love
His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;,renaissance_love
Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;,renaissance_love
"Others, because of both sides I do take",renaissance_love
"My blood from them who did excel in this,",renaissance_love
Think Nature me a man of arms did make.,renaissance_love
"How far they shot awry! The true cause is,",renaissance_love
"Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face",renaissance_love
Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race.,renaissance_love
"No more, my dear, no more these counsels try;",renaissance_love
"Oh, give my passions leave to run their race;",renaissance_love
Let Fortune lay on me her worst disgrace;,renaissance_love
Let folk o'ercharg'd with brain against me cry;,renaissance_love
"Let clouds bedim my face, break in mine eye;",renaissance_love
Let me no steps but of lost labour trace;,renaissance_love
"Let all the earth with scorn recount my case,",renaissance_love
But do not will me from my love to fly.,renaissance_love
"I do not envy Aristotle's wit,",renaissance_love
Nor do aspire to Caesar's bleeding fame;,renaissance_love
Nor aught do care though some above me sit;,renaissance_love
"Nor hope nor wish another course to frame,",renaissance_love
But that which once may win thy cruel heart:,renaissance_love
"Thou art my wit, and thou my virtue art.",renaissance_love
"When Nature made her chief work, Stella's eyes,",renaissance_love
In colour black why wrapt she beams so bright?,renaissance_love
"Would she in beamy black, like painter wise,",renaissance_love
"Frame daintiest lustre, mix'd of shades and light?",renaissance_love
"Or did she else that sober hue devise,",renaissance_love
In object best to knit and strength our sight;,renaissance_love
"Lest, if no veil these brave gleams did disguise,",renaissance_love
"They, sunlike, should more dazzle than delight?",renaissance_love
"Or would she her miraculous power show,",renaissance_love
"That, whereas black seems beauty's contrary,",renaissance_love
She even in black doth make all beauties flow?,renaissance_love
"Both so, and thus, she, minding Love should be",renaissance_love
"Plac'd ever there, gave him this mourning weed",renaissance_love
To honour all their deaths who for her bleed.,renaissance_love

"And, not content to be perfection's heir",renaissance_love
"Thyself, dost strive all minds that way to move,",renaissance_love
Who mark in thee what is in thee most fair.,renaissance_love
"So while thy beauty draws thy heart to love,",renaissance_love
As fast thy virtue bends that love to good:,renaissance_love
"But ""Ah,"" Desire still cries, ""Give me some food!""",renaissance_love
"Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,",renaissance_love
"And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,",renaissance_love
Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet,renaissance_love
More oft than to a chamber melody.,renaissance_love
"Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me",renaissance_love
"To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:",renaissance_love
My Muse and I must you of duty greet,renaissance_love

Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss.,renaissance_love
"Be your words made, good sir, of Indian ware,",renaissance_love
That you allow me them by so small rate?,renaissance_love

That to my questions you so total are?,renaissance_love
"When I demand of Phoenix Stella's state,",renaissance_love
"You say, forsooth, you left her well of late:",renaissance_love

I would know whether she did sit or walk;,renaissance_love
"How cloth'd, how waited on; sigh'd she, or smil'd;",renaissance_love
"Whereof, with whom, how often did she talk;",renaissance_love
With what pastime time's journey she beguiled;,renaissance_love
If her lips deign'd to sweeten my poor name.,renaissance_love
"Say all; and all well said, still say the same.",renaissance_love
Avising the bright beams of these fair eyes,renaissance_love
"Where he is that mine oft moisteth and washeth,",renaissance_love
The wearied mind straight from the heart departeth,renaissance_love
For to rest in his worldly paradise,renaissance_love
And find the sweet bitter under this guise.,renaissance_love
What webs he hath wrought well he perceiveth,renaissance_love
Whereby with himself on love he plaineth,renaissance_love
That spurreth with fire and bridleth with ice.,renaissance_love

         And we in us find the eagle and the dove.,renaissance_love
                The phnix riddle hath more wit,renaissance_love
"                By us; we two being one, are it.",renaissance_love
"So, to one neutral thing both sexes fit.",renaissance_love
"         We die and rise the same, and prove",renaissance_love
         Mysterious by this love.,renaissance_love
"We can die by it, if not live by love,",renaissance_love
         And if unfit for tombs and hearse,renaissance_love
"Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;",renaissance_love
"         And if no piece of chronicle we prove,",renaissance_love
                We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;,renaissance_love
                As well a well-wrought urn becomes,renaissance_love
"The greatest ashes, as half-acre tombs,",renaissance_love
"         And by these hymns, all shall approve",renaissance_love
         Us canonized for Love.,renaissance_love
"And thus invoke us: ""You, whom reverend love",renaissance_love
         Made one another's hermitage;,renaissance_love
"You, to whom love was peace, that now is rage;",renaissance_love
"         Who did the whole world's soul contract, and drove",renaissance_love
                Into the glasses of your eyes,renaissance_love
"                (So made such mirrors, and such spies,",renaissance_love
That they did all to you epitomize),renaissance_love
"         Countries, towns, courts: beg from above",renaissance_love
"         A pattern of your love!""Let it not your wonder move,",renaissance_love
"Less your laughter, that I love.",renaissance_love
"Though I now write fifty years,",renaissance_love
"I have had, and have, my peers;",renaissance_love
"Poets, though divine, are men,",renaissance_love
Some have lov'd as old again.,renaissance_love
"And it is not always face,",renaissance_love
"Clothes, or fortune, gives the grace;",renaissance_love
"Or the feature, or the youth.",renaissance_love
"But the language and the truth,",renaissance_love
"With the ardour and the passion,",renaissance_love
Gives the lover weight and fashion.,renaissance_love
"If you then will read the story,",renaissance_love
First prepare you to be sorry,renaissance_love
That you never knew till now,renaissance_love
Either whom to love or how;,renaissance_love
"But be glad, as soon with me,",renaissance_love
When you know that this is she,renaissance_love
Of whose beauty it was sung;,renaissance_love
"She shall make the old man young,",renaissance_love
"Keep the middle age at stay,",renaissance_love
"And let nothing high decay,",renaissance_love
Till she be the reason why,renaissance_love
All the world for love may die.,renaissance_love
"See the chariot at hand here of Love,",renaissance_love
Wherein my lady rideth!,renaissance_love
"Each that draws is a swan or a dove,",renaissance_love
And well the car Love guideth.,renaissance_love
"As she goes, all hearts do duty",renaissance_love
Unto her beauty;,renaissance_love
"And enamour'd, do wish, so they might",renaissance_love
"But enjoy such a sight,",renaissance_love
"That they still were to run by her side,",renaissance_love
"Through swords, through seas, whither she would ride.",renaissance_love
"Do but look on her eyes, they do light",renaissance_love
All that Love's world compriseth!,renaissance_love
"Do but look on her hair, it is bright",renaissance_love
As Love's star when it riseth!,renaissance_love
"Do but mark, her forehead's smoother",renaissance_love
Than words that soothe her;,renaissance_love
"And from her arched brows, such a grace",renaissance_love
Sheds itself through the face,renaissance_love
As alone there triumphs to the life,renaissance_love
"All the gain, all the good, of the elements' strife.",renaissance_love
"Have you seen but a bright lily grow,",renaissance_love
Before rude hands have touch'd it?,renaissance_love
Ha' you mark'd but the fall o' the snow,renaissance_love
Before the soil hath smutch'd it?,renaissance_love
Ha' you felt the wool o' the beaver?,renaissance_love
Or swan's down ever?,renaissance_love
Or have smelt o' the bud o' the briar?,renaissance_love
Or the nard in the fire?,renaissance_love
Or have tasted the bag of the bee?,renaissance_love
Oh so white! Oh so soft! Oh so sweet is she!,renaissance_love
"Muses that sing love's sensual empery,",renaissance_love
And lovers kindling your enraged fires,renaissance_love
"At Cupid's bonfires burning in the eye,",renaissance_love
Blown with the empty breath of vain desires;,renaissance_love
You that prefer the painted cabinet,renaissance_love
"Before the wealthy jewels it doth store ye,",renaissance_love
"That all your joys in dying figures set,",renaissance_love
And stain the living substance of your glory;,renaissance_love
"Abjure those joys, abhor their memory,",renaissance_love
And let my love the honour'd subject be,renaissance_love
"Of love, and honour's complete history.",renaissance_love
Your eyes were never yet let in to see,renaissance_love
"The majesty and riches of the mind,",renaissance_love
But dwell in darkness; for your god is blind.,renaissance_love
"Dear love, for nothing less than thee",renaissance_love
Would I have broke this happy dream;,renaissance_love
            It was a theme,renaissance_love
"For reason, much too strong for fantasy,",renaissance_love
Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet,renaissance_love
"My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it.",renaissance_love
Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice,renaissance_love
"To make dreams truths, and fables histories;",renaissance_love
"Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best,",renaissance_love
"Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.",renaissance_love
"   As lightning, or a taper's light,",renaissance_love
"Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;",renaissance_love
            Yet I thought thee,renaissance_love
"(For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight;",renaissance_love
"But when I saw thou sawest my heart,",renaissance_love
"And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art,",renaissance_love
"When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when",renaissance_love
"Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then,",renaissance_love
"I must confess, it could not choose but be",renaissance_love
"Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.",renaissance_love
"   Coming and staying show'd thee, thee,",renaissance_love
"But rising makes me doubt, that now",renaissance_love
            Thou art not thou.,renaissance_love
That love is weak where fear's as strong as he;,renaissance_love
"'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave,",renaissance_love
"If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have;",renaissance_love
"Perchance as torches, which must ready be,",renaissance_love
"Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me;",renaissance_love
"Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I",renaissance_love
"Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",renaissance_love
"Where, like a pillow on a bed",renaissance_love
         A pregnant bank swell'd up to rest,renaissance_love
"The violet's reclining head,",renaissance_love
"         Sat we two, one another's best.",renaissance_love
Our hands were firmly cemented,renaissance_love
"         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;",renaissance_love
"Our eye-beams twisted, and did thread",renaissance_love
         Our eyes upon one double string;,renaissance_love
"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance_love
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance_love
And pictures in our eyes to get,renaissance_love
         Was all our propagation.,renaissance_love
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance_love
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance_love
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance_love
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance_love
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance_love
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance_love
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance_love
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance_love
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance_love
"         That he soul's language understood,",renaissance_love
"And by good love were grown all mind,",renaissance_love
"         Within convenient distance stood,",renaissance_love
"He (though he knew not which soul spake,",renaissance_love
"         Because both meant, both spake the same)",renaissance_love
Might thence a new concoction take,renaissance_love
         And part far purer than he came.,renaissance_love
"This ecstasy doth unperplex,",renaissance_love
"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance_love
"We see by this it was not sex,",renaissance_love
         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance_love
But as all several souls contain,renaissance_love
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance_love
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance_love
"         And makes both one, each this and that.",renaissance_love
"A single violet transplant,",renaissance_love
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance_love
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance_love
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance_love
When love with one another so,renaissance_love
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance_love
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance_love
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance_love
"We then, who are this new soul, know",renaissance_love
"         Of what we are compos'd and made,",renaissance_love
For th' atomies of which we grow,renaissance_love
"         Are souls, whom no change can invade.",renaissance_love
"But oh alas, so long, so far,",renaissance_love
         Our bodies why do we forbear?,renaissance_love
"They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are",renaissance_love
"         The intelligences, they the spheres.",renaissance_love
"We owe them thanks, because they thus",renaissance_love
"         Did us, to us, at first convey,",renaissance_love
"Yielded their senses' force to us,",renaissance_love
"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance_love
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance_love
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance_love
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance_love
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance_love
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance_love
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance_love
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance_love
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance_love
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance_love
"         T' affections, and to faculties,",renaissance_love
"Which sense may reach and apprehend,",renaissance_love
         Else a great prince in prison lies.,renaissance_love
"To'our bodies turn we then, that so",renaissance_love
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;,renaissance_love
"Love's mysteries in souls do grow,",renaissance_love
         But yet the body is his book.,renaissance_love
"And if some lover, such as we,",renaissance_love
"         Have heard this dialogue of one,",renaissance_love
"Let him still mark us, he shall see",renaissance_love
"         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.",renaissance_love
         No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace,renaissance_love
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.,renaissance_love
"Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,",renaissance_love
"         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.",renaissance_love
"If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;",renaissance_love
         Affection here takes reverence's name.,renaissance_love
"Were her first years the golden age? That's true,",renaissance_love
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.,renaissance_love
"That was her torrid and inflaming time,",renaissance_love
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.,renaissance_love
"Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,",renaissance_love
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.,renaissance_love
"Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,",renaissance_love
"         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.",renaissance_love
"Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit",renaissance_love
"         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;",renaissance_love
"And here till hers, which must be his death, come,",renaissance_love
"         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.",renaissance_love
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere,renaissance_love
"         In progress, yet his standing house is here:",renaissance_love
"Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,",renaissance_love
"         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.",renaissance_love
"In all her words, unto all hearers fit,",renaissance_love
"         You may at revels, you at council, sit.",renaissance_love
"This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;",renaissance_love
"         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,",renaissance_love
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste,renaissance_love
         And appetite to other things is past.,renaissance_love
"Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,",renaissance_love
"         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,",renaissance_love
"Or else because, being young, nature did bless",renaissance_love
"         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.",renaissance_love
"If we love things long sought, age is a thing",renaissance_love
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;,renaissance_love
"If transitory things, which soon decay,",renaissance_love
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.,renaissance_love
"But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,",renaissance_love
"         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;",renaissance_love
"Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;",renaissance_love
"         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;",renaissance_love
"Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,",renaissance_love
         To vex their souls at resurrection:,renaissance_love
"Name not these living death's-heads unto me,",renaissance_love
"         For these, not ancient, but antique be.",renaissance_love
"I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay",renaissance_love
"         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.",renaissance_love
"Since such love's natural lation is, may still",renaissance_love
"         My love descend, and journey down the hill,",renaissance_love
"Not panting after growing beauties. So,",renaissance_love
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.,renaissance_love
         Here take my picture; though I bid farewell,renaissance_love
"Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.",renaissance_love
"'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more",renaissance_love
"When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.",renaissance_love
"When weather-beaten I come back, my hand",renaissance_love
"Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,",renaissance_love
"My face and breast of haircloth, and my head",renaissance_love
"With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,",renaissance_love
"My body'a sack of bones, broken within,",renaissance_love
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;,renaissance_love
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man,renaissance_love
"So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,",renaissance_love
"This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,",renaissance_love
Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?,renaissance_love
"Or do they reach his judging mind, that he",renaissance_love
"Should now love less, what he did love to see?",renaissance_love
"That which in him was fair and delicate,",renaissance_love
Was but the milk which in love's childish state,renaissance_love
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough,renaissance_love
"To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.",renaissance_love
Who is it that this dark night Underneath my window plaineth?,renaissance_love
It is one who from thy sight,renaissance_love
"Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth",renaissance_love
Every other vulgar light.,renaissance_love
"Why, alas, and are you he?
Be not yet those fancies changed?",renaissance_love
"Dear, when you find change in me,",renaissance_love
"Though from me you be estranged,",renaissance_love
Let my change to ruin be.,renaissance_love
"Well, in absence this will die;
Leave to see, and leave to wonder.",renaissance_love
"Absence sure will help, if I",renaissance_love
Can learn how myself to sunder,renaissance_love
From what in my heart doth lie.,renaissance_love
"But time will these thoughts remove;
Time doth work what no man knoweth.",renaissance_love
Time doth as the subject prove;,renaissance_love
With time still the affection groweth,renaissance_love
In the faithful turtle-dove.,renaissance_love
"What if you new beauties see?
Will not they stir new affection?",renaissance_love
"I will think they pictures be,",renaissance_love
"Image-like, of saints' perfection,",renaissance_love
Poorly counterfeiting thee.,renaissance_love
"But your reason's purest light
Bids you leave such minds to nourish.",renaissance_love
"Dear, do reason no such spite;",renaissance_love
Never doth thy beauty flourish,renaissance_love
More than in my reason's sight.,renaissance_love
"But the wrongs love bears will make
Love at length leave undertaking.",renaissance_love
"No, the more fools it do shake,",renaissance_love
In a ground of so firm making,renaissance_love
Deeper still they drive the stake.,renaissance_love
"Peace, I think that some give ear!
Come no more, lest I get anger!",renaissance_love
"Bliss, I will my bliss forbear;",renaissance_love
"Fearing, sweet, you to endanger;",renaissance_love
But my soul shall harbour there.,renaissance_love
"Well, begone; begone, I say,
Lest that Argus' eyes perceive you!",renaissance_love
"Oh, unjust Fortune's sway,",renaissance_love
Which can make me thus to leave you;,renaissance_love
And from louts to run away.,renaissance_love
Farewell love and all thy laws forever;,renaissance_love
Thy baited hooks shall tangle me no more.,renaissance_love
Senec and Plato call me from thy lore,renaissance_love
"To perfect wealth, my wit for to endeavour.",renaissance_love
"In blind error when I did persever,",renaissance_love
"Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore,",renaissance_love
Hath taught me to set in trifles no store,renaissance_love
"And scape forth, since liberty is lever.",renaissance_love
Therefore farewell; go trouble younger hearts,renaissance_love
And in me claim no more authority.,renaissance_love
With idle youth go use thy property,renaissance_love
"And thereon spend thy many brittle darts,",renaissance_love
"For hitherto though I have lost all my time,",renaissance_love
Me lusteth no lenger rotten boughs to climb.,renaissance_love
"Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow,",renaissance_love
Though thou be black as night,renaissance_love
"And she made all of light,",renaissance_love
Yet follow thy fair sun unhappy shadow.,renaissance_love
"Follow her whose light thy light depriveth,",renaissance_love
"Though here thou livst disgraced,",renaissance_love
"And she in heaven is placed,",renaissance_love
Yet follow her whose light the world reviveth.,renaissance_love
"Follow those pure beams whose beauty burneth,",renaissance_love
"That so have scorched thee,",renaissance_love
"As thou still black must be,",renaissance_love
Till Her kind beams thy black to brightness turneth.,renaissance_love
"Follow her while yet her glory shineth,",renaissance_love
"There comes a luckless night,",renaissance_love
"That will dim all her light,",renaissance_love
And this the black unhappy shade divineth.,renaissance_love
"Follow still since so thy fates ordained,",renaissance_love
"The Sun must have his shade,",renaissance_love
"Till both at once do fade,",renaissance_love
"The Sun still proved, the shadow still disdained.",renaissance_love
"Follow your saint, follow with accents sweet;",renaissance_love
"Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.",renaissance_love
"There, wrapp'd in cloud of sorrow, pity move,",renaissance_love
And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her love:,renaissance_love
"But if she scorns my never-ceasing pain,",renaissance_love
Then burst with sighing in her sight and ne'er return again.,renaissance_love
"All that I sung still to her praise did tend,",renaissance_love
Still she was first; still she my songs did end;,renaissance_love
"Yet she my love and music both doth fly,",renaissance_love
The music that her echo is and beauty's sympathy.,renaissance_love
Then let my notes pursue her scornful flight:,renaissance_love
It shall suffice that they were breath'd and died for her delight.,renaissance_love
Forget not yet the tried intent,renaissance_love
Of such a truth as I have meant;,renaissance_love
"My great travail so gladly spent,",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
   Forget not yet when first began,renaissance_love
"The weary life ye know, since whan",renaissance_love
"The suit, the service, none tell can;",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not yet the great assays,",renaissance_love
"The cruel wrong, the scornful ways;",renaissance_love
"The painful patience in denays,",renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not yet, forget not this,",renaissance_love
How long ago hath been and is,renaissance_love
The mind that never meant amiss;,renaissance_love
            Forget not yet.,renaissance_love
"   Forget not then thine own approved,",renaissance_love
"The which so long hath thee so loved,",renaissance_love
Whose steadfast faith yet never moved;,renaissance_love
            Forget not this.,renaissance_love
"            Whoever comes to shroud me, do not harm",renaissance_love
         Nor question much,renaissance_love
"That subtle wreath of hair, which crowns my arm;",renaissance_love
"The mystery, the sign, you must not touch,",renaissance_love
"         For 'tis my outward soul,",renaissance_love
"Viceroy to that, which then to heaven being gone,",renaissance_love
         Will leave this to control,renaissance_love
"And keep these limbs, her provinces, from dissolution.",renaissance_love
For if the sinewy thread my brain lets fall,renaissance_love
         Through every part,renaissance_love
"Can tie those parts, and make me one of all,",renaissance_love
"Those hairs which upward grew, and strength and art",renaissance_love
"         Have from a better brain,",renaissance_love
Can better do'it; except she meant that I,renaissance_love
"         By this should know my pain,",renaissance_love
"As prisoners then are manacled, when they'are condemn'd to die.",renaissance_love
"Whate'er she meant by'it, bury it with me,",renaissance_love
         For since I am,renaissance_love
"Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,",renaissance_love
If into other hands these relics came;,renaissance_love
         As 'twas humility,renaissance_love
"To afford to it all that a soul can do,",renaissance_love
"         So, 'tis some bravery,",renaissance_love
"That since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.",renaissance_love
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I",renaissance_love
"Did, till we loved? Were we not weaned till then?",renaissance_love
"But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?",renaissance_love
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers den?,renaissance_love
"Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.",renaissance_love
"If ever any beauty I did see,",renaissance_love
"Which I desired, and got, twas but a dream of thee.",renaissance_love
"And now good-morrow to our waking souls,",renaissance_love
Which watch not one another out of fear;,renaissance_love
"For love, all love of other sights controls,",renaissance_love
And makes one little room an everywhere.,renaissance_love
"Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,",renaissance_love
"Let maps to other, worlds on worlds have shown,",renaissance_love
"Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.",renaissance_love
"My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,",renaissance_love
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;,renaissance_love
"Where can we find two better hemispheres,",renaissance_love
"Without sharp north, without declining west?",renaissance_love
"Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;",renaissance_love
"If our two loves be one, or, thou and I",renaissance_love
"Love so alike, that none do slacken, none can die.",renaissance_love
The heart and service to you proffer'd,renaissance_love
"With right good will full honestly,",renaissance_love
"Refuse it not, since it is offer'd,",renaissance_love
But take it to you gentlely.,renaissance_love
"And though it be a small present,",renaissance_love
"Yet good, consider graciously",renaissance_love
"The thought, the mind, and the intent",renaissance_love
Of him that loves you faithfully.,renaissance_love
It were a thing of small effect,renaissance_love
"To work my woe thus cruelly,",renaissance_love
For my good will to be abject:,renaissance_love
Therefore accept it lovingly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or travel, to run or ride,",renaissance_love
I undertake it pleasantly;,renaissance_love
"Bid ye me go, and straight I glide",renaissance_love
At your commandement humbly.,renaissance_love
"Pain or pleasure, now may you plant",renaissance_love
Even which it please you steadfastly;,renaissance_love
"Do which you list, I shall not want",renaissance_love
To be your servant secretly.,renaissance_love
And since so much I do desire,renaissance_love
"To be your own assuredly,",renaissance_love
For all my service and my hire,renaissance_love
Reward your servant liberally.,renaissance_love
"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,",renaissance_love
"In view and opposite two cities stood,",renaissance_love
"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might;",renaissance_love
"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.",renaissance_love
"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,",renaissance_love
"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair,",renaissance_love
"And offer'd as a dower his burning throne,",renaissance_love
Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance_love
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance_love
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance_love
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance_love
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance_love
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance_love
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance_love
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance_love
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance_love
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance_love
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance_love
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance_love
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance_love
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance_love
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance_love
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance_love
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance_love
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance_love
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance_love
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance_love
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance_love
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance_love
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance_love
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance_love
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance_love
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance_love
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance_love
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance_love
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance_love
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance_love
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance_love
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance_love
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance_love
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance_love
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance_love
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance_love
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance_love
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance_love
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance_love
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance_love
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance_love
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance_love
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance_love
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance_love
"(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),",renaissance_love
Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance_love
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance_love
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance_love
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance_love
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance_love
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance_love
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance_love
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance_love
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance_love
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance_love
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance_love
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance_love
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance_love
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance_love
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance_love
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance_love
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance_love
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance_love
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance_love
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance_love
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance_love
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance_love
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance_love
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance_love
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance_love
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance_love
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance_love
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance_love
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance_love
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance_love
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance_love
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance_love
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance_love
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance_love
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance_love
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;
Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?
Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance_love
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance_love
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance_love
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance_love
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance_love
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance_love
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance_love
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance_love
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance_love
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance_love
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance_love
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance_love
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance_love
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance_love
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance_love
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance_love
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance_love
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance_love
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance_love
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance_love
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance_love
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance_love
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance_love
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance_love
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance_love
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance_love
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance_love
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance_love
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance_love
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance_love
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance_love
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance_love
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance_love
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance_love
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance_love
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance_love
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance_love
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance_love
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance_love
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance_love
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance_love
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance_love
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance_love
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance_love
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance_love
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance_love
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance_love
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance_love
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance_love
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance_love
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance_love
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance_love
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance_love
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance_love
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance_love
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance_love
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance_love
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance_love
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance_love
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance_love
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance_love
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance_love
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance_love
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance_love
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance_love
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance_love
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance_love
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance_love
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance_love
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance_love
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance_love
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance_love
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance_love
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance_love
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance_love
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance_love
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance_love
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance_love
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance_love
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance_love
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance_love
And one especially do we affect,renaissance_love
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance_love
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance_love
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance_love
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance_love
"Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?",renaissance_love
"Show me dear Christ, thy spouse so bright and clear.",renaissance_love
What! is it she which on the other shore,renaissance_love
"Goes richly painted? or which, robb'd and tore,",renaissance_love
Laments and mourns in Germany and here?,renaissance_love
"Sleeps she a thousand, then peeps up one year?",renaissance_love
"Is she self-truth, and errs? now new, now outwore?",renaissance_love
"Doth she, and did she, and shall she evermore",renaissance_love
"On one, on seven, or on no hill appear?",renaissance_love
"Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights",renaissance_love
"First travel we to seek, and then make love?",renaissance_love
"Betray, kind husband, thy spouse to our sights,",renaissance_love
"And let mine amorous soul court thy mild Dove,",renaissance_love
Who is most true and pleasing to thee then,renaissance_love
When she'is embrac'd and open to most men.,renaissance_love
Since she whom I lov'd hath paid her last debt,renaissance_love
"To nature, and to hers, and my good is dead,",renaissance_love
"And her soul early into heaven ravished,",renaissance_love
Wholly in heavenly things my mind is set.,renaissance_love
Here the admiring her my mind did whet,renaissance_love
"To seek thee, God; so streams do show the head;",renaissance_love
"But though I have found thee, and thou my thirst hast fed,",renaissance_love
A holy thirsty dropsy melts me yet.,renaissance_love
"But why should I beg more love, whenas thou",renaissance_love
"Dost woo my soul, for hers off'ring all thine,",renaissance_love
And dost not only fear lest I allow,renaissance_love
"My love to saints and angels, things divine,",renaissance_love
But in thy tender jealousy dost doubt,renaissance_love
"Lest the world, flesh, yea devil put thee out.",renaissance_love
"I find no peace, and all my war is done.",renaissance_love
I fear and hope. I burn and freeze like ice.,renaissance_love
"I fly above the wind, yet can I not arise;",renaissance_love
"And nought I have, and all the world I season.",renaissance_love
That loseth nor locketh holdeth me in prison,renaissance_love
And holdeth me notyet can I scape no wise,renaissance_love
"Nor letteth me live nor die at my device,",renaissance_love
And yet of death it giveth me occasion.,renaissance_love
"Without eyen I see, and without tongue I plain.",renaissance_love
"I desire to perish, and yet I ask health.",renaissance_love
"I love another, and thus I hate myself.",renaissance_love
I feed me in sorrow and laugh in all my pain;,renaissance_love
"Likewise displeaseth me both life and death,",renaissance_love
And my delight is causer of this strife.,renaissance_love
"Unhappy verse, the witness of my unhappy state,",renaissance_love
Make thy self flutt'ring wings of thy fast flying,renaissance_love
"Thought, and fly forth unto my love, wheresoever she be:",renaissance_love
"Whether lying restless in heavy bed, or else",renaissance_love
"Sitting so cheerless at the cheerful board, or else",renaissance_love
Playing alone careless on her heavenly virginals.,renaissance_love
"If in bed, tell her, that my eyes can take no rest:",renaissance_love
"If at board, tell her, that my mouth can eat no meat:",renaissance_love
"If at her virginals, tell her, I can hear no mirth.",renaissance_love
Asked why? say: waking love suffereth no sleep:,renaissance_love
Say that raging love doth appal the weak stomach:,renaissance_love
"Say, that lamenting love marreth the musical.",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her pleasures were wont to lull me asleep:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her beauty was wont to feed mine eyes:",renaissance_love
"Tell her, that her sweet tongue was wont to make me mirth.",renaissance_love
"Now do I nightly waste, wanting my kindly rest:",renaissance_love
"Now do I daily starve, wanting my lively food:",renaissance_love
"Now do I always die, wanting thy timely mirth.",renaissance_love
"And if I waste, who will bewail my heavy chance?",renaissance_love
"And if I starve, who will record my cursed end?",renaissance_love
"And if I die, who will say: ""This was Immerito""?",renaissance_love
"I can love both fair and brown,",renaissance_love
"Her whom abundance melts, and her whom want betrays,",renaissance_love
"Her who loves loneness best, and her who masks and plays,",renaissance_love
"Her whom the country formed, and whom the town,",renaissance_love
"Her who believes, and her who tries,",renaissance_love
"Her who still weeps with spongy eyes,",renaissance_love
"And her who is dry cork, and never cries;",renaissance_love
"I can love her, and her, and you, and you,",renaissance_love
"I can love any, so she be not true.",renaissance_love
Will no other vice content you?,renaissance_love
Will it not serve your turn to do as did your mothers?,renaissance_love
"Or have you all old vices spent, and now would find out others?",renaissance_love
Or doth a fear that men are true torment you?,renaissance_love
"O we are not, be not you so;",renaissance_love
"Let me, and do you, twenty know.",renaissance_love
"Rob me, but bind me not, and let me go.",renaissance_love
"Must I, who came to travail thorough you,",renaissance_love
"Grow your fixed subject, because you are true?",renaissance_love
"Venus heard me sigh this song,",renaissance_love
"And by love's sweetest part, variety, she swore,",renaissance_love
She heard not this till now; and that it should be so no more.,renaissance_love
"She went, examined, and returned ere long,",renaissance_love
"And said, Alas! some two or three",renaissance_love
"Poor heretics in love there be,",renaissance_love
Which think to stablish dangerous constancy.,renaissance_love
"But I have told them, Since you will be true,",renaissance_love
You shall be true to them who are false to you.,renaissance_love
"Leave me, O Love, which reachest but to dust;",renaissance_love
"And thou, my mind, aspire to higher things;",renaissance_love
Grow rich in that which never taketh rust;,renaissance_love
Whatever fades but fading pleasure brings.,renaissance_love
Draw in thy beams and humble all thy might,renaissance_love
To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be;,renaissance_love
"Which breaks the clouds and opens forth the light,",renaissance_love
That both doth shine and give us sight to see.,renaissance_love
O take fast hold; let that light be thy guide,renaissance_love
"In this small course which birth draws out to death,",renaissance_love
"And think how evil becometh him to slide,",renaissance_love
"Who seeketh heav'n, and comes of heav'nly breath.",renaissance_love
"Then farewell, world; thy uttermost I see:",renaissance_love
"Eternal Love, maintain thy life in me.",renaissance_love
"Stand still, and I will read to thee",renaissance_love
"A lecture, love, in love's philosophy.",renaissance_love
"         These three hours that we have spent,",renaissance_love
"         Walking here, two shadows went",renaissance_love
"Along with us, which we ourselves produc'd.",renaissance_love
"But, now the sun is just above our head,",renaissance_love
"         We do those shadows tread,",renaissance_love
         And to brave clearness all things are reduc'd.,renaissance_love
"So whilst our infant loves did grow,",renaissance_love
"Disguises did, and shadows, flow",renaissance_love
"From us, and our cares; but now 'tis not so.",renaissance_love
"That love has not attain'd the high'st degree,",renaissance_love
Which is still diligent lest others see.,renaissance_love
"Except our loves at this noon stay,",renaissance_love
We shall new shadows make the other way.,renaissance_love
         As the first were made to blind,renaissance_love
"         Others, these which come behind",renaissance_love
"Will work upon ourselves, and blind our eyes.",renaissance_love
"If our loves faint, and westwardly decline,",renaissance_love
"         To me thou, falsely, thine,",renaissance_love
         And I to thee mine actions shall disguise.,renaissance_love
"The morning shadows wear away,",renaissance_love
But these grow longer all the day;,renaissance_love
"But oh, love's day is short, if love decay.",renaissance_love
"Love is a growing, or full constant light,",renaissance_love
"And his first minute, after noon, is night.",renaissance_love
The longe love that in my thought doth harbour,renaissance_love
"And in mine hert doth keep his residence,",renaissance_love
Into my face presseth with bold pretence,renaissance_love
"And therein campeth, spreading his banner.",renaissance_love
She that me learneth to love and suffer,renaissance_love
And will that my trust and lustes negligence,renaissance_love
"Be rayned by reason, shame, and reverence,",renaissance_love
With his hardiness taketh displeasure.,renaissance_love
"Wherewithall unto the hert's forest he fleeth,",renaissance_love
"Leaving his enterprise with pain and cry,",renaissance_love
And there him hideth and not appeareth.,renaissance_love
What may I do when my master feareth,renaissance_love
But in the field with him to live and die?,renaissance_love
For good is the life ending faithfully.,renaissance_love
"Some that have deeper digg'd love's mine than I,",renaissance_love
"Say, where his centric happiness doth lie;",renaissance_love
"         I have lov'd, and got, and told,",renaissance_love
"But should I love, get, tell, till I were old,",renaissance_love
I should not find that hidden mystery.,renaissance_love
"         Oh, 'tis imposture all!",renaissance_love
"And as no chemic yet th'elixir got,",renaissance_love
         But glorifies his pregnant pot,renaissance_love
         If by the way to him befall,renaissance_love
"Some odoriferous thing, or medicinal,",renaissance_love
"         So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,",renaissance_love
         But get a winter-seeming summer's night.,renaissance_love
"Our ease, our thrift, our honour, and our day,",renaissance_love
Shall we for this vain bubble's shadow pay?,renaissance_love
"         Ends love in this, that my man",renaissance_love
"Can be as happy'as I can, if he can",renaissance_love
Endure the short scorn of a bridegroom's play?,renaissance_love
         That loving wretch that swears,renaissance_love
"'Tis not the bodies marry, but the minds,",renaissance_love
"         Which he in her angelic finds,",renaissance_love
"         Would swear as justly that he hears,",renaissance_love
"In that day's rude hoarse minstrelsy, the spheres.",renaissance_love
         Hope not for mind in women; at their best,renaissance_love
"         Sweetness and wit, they'are but mummy, possess'd.",renaissance_love
"         I long to talk with some old lover's ghost,",renaissance_love
      Who died before the god of love was born.,renaissance_love
"I cannot think that he, who then lov'd most,",renaissance_love
      Sunk so low as to love one which did scorn.,renaissance_love
"But since this god produc'd a destiny,",renaissance_love
"And that vice-nature, custom, lets it be,",renaissance_love
"      I must love her, that loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Sure, they which made him god, meant not so much,",renaissance_love
      Nor he in his young godhead practis'd it.,renaissance_love
"But when an even flame two hearts did touch,",renaissance_love
      His office was indulgently to fit,renaissance_love
Actives to passives. Correspondency,renaissance_love
Only his subject was; it cannot be,renaissance_love
"      Love, till I love her, that loves me.",renaissance_love
   But every modern god will now extend,renaissance_love
      His vast prerogative as far as Jove.,renaissance_love
"To rage, to lust, to write to, to commend,",renaissance_love
      All is the purlieu of the god of love.,renaissance_love
O! were we waken'd by this tyranny,renaissance_love
"To ungod this child again, it could not be",renaissance_love
"      I should love her, who loves not me.",renaissance_love
"   Rebel and atheist too, why murmur I,",renaissance_love
      As though I felt the worst that love could do?,renaissance_love
"Love might make me leave loving, or might try",renaissance_love
"      A deeper plague, to make her love me too;",renaissance_love
"Which, since she loves before, I'am loth to see.",renaissance_love
"Falsehood is worse than hate; and that must be,",renaissance_love
"      If she whom I love, should love me.",renaissance_love
"      If yet I have not all thy love,",renaissance_love
"Dear, I shall never have it all;",renaissance_love
"I cannot breathe one other sigh, to move,",renaissance_love
Nor can intreat one other tear to fall;,renaissance_love
"And all my treasure, which should purchase thee",renaissance_love
"Sighs, tears, and oaths, and lettersI have spent.",renaissance_love
"Yet no more can be due to me,",renaissance_love
Than at the bargain made was meant;,renaissance_love
"If then thy gift of love were partial,",renaissance_love
"That some to me, some should to others fall,",renaissance_love
"         Dear, I shall never have thee all.",renaissance_love
"Or if then thou gavest me all,",renaissance_love
"All was but all, which thou hadst then;",renaissance_love
"But if in thy heart, since, there be or shall",renaissance_love
"New love created be, by other men,",renaissance_love
"Which have their stocks entire, and can in tears,",renaissance_love
"In sighs, in oaths, and letters, outbid me,",renaissance_love
"This new love may beget new fears,",renaissance_love
For this love was not vow'd by thee.,renaissance_love
"And yet it was, thy gift being general;",renaissance_love
"The ground, thy heart, is mine; whatever shall",renaissance_love
"         Grow there, dear, I should have it all.",renaissance_love
"Yet I would not have all yet,",renaissance_love
He that hath all can have no more;,renaissance_love
And since my love doth every day admit,renaissance_love
"New growth, thou shouldst have new rewards in store;",renaissance_love
"Thou canst not every day give me thy heart,",renaissance_love
"If thou canst give it, then thou never gavest it;",renaissance_love
"Love's riddles are, that though thy heart depart,",renaissance_love
"It stays at home, and thou with losing savest it;",renaissance_love
"But we will have a way more liberal,",renaissance_love
"Than changing hearts, to join them; so we shall",renaissance_love
"         Be one, and one another's all.",renaissance_love
"         Madam, withouten many words",renaissance_love
    Once I am sure ye will or no ...,renaissance_love
"And if ye will, then leave your bourds",renaissance_love
"    And use your wit and show it so,",renaissance_love
And with a beck ye shall me call;,renaissance_love
    And if of one that burneth alway,renaissance_love
"Ye have any pity at all,",renaissance_love
    Answer him fair with & {.} or nay.,renaissance_love
"If it be &, {.} I shall be fain;",renaissance_love
"    If it be nay, friends as before;",renaissance_love
"Ye shall another man obtain,",renaissance_love
    And I mine own and yours no more.,renaissance_love
    My lute awake! perform the last,renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And end that I have now begun;,renaissance_love
"For when this song is sung and past,",renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"As to be heard where ear is none,",renaissance_love
"As lead to grave in marble stone,",renaissance_love
My song may pierce her heart as soon;,renaissance_love
Should we then sigh or sing or moan?,renaissance_love
"No, no, my lute, for I have done.",renaissance_love
The rocks do not so cruelly,renaissance_love
"Repulse the waves continually,",renaissance_love
As she my suit and affection;,renaissance_love
"So that I am past remedy,",renaissance_love
Whereby my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Proud of the spoil that thou hast got,renaissance_love
"Of simple hearts thorough Love's shot,",renaissance_love
"By whom, unkind, thou hast them won,",renaissance_love
"Think not he hath his bow forgot,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Vengeance shall fall on thy disdain,renaissance_love
That makest but game on earnest pain.,renaissance_love
Think not alone under the sun,renaissance_love
"Unquit to cause thy lovers plain,",renaissance_love
Although my lute and I have done.,renaissance_love
Perchance thee lie wethered and old,renaissance_love
"The winter nights that are so cold,",renaissance_love
Plaining in vain unto the moon;,renaissance_love
Thy wishes then dare not be told;,renaissance_love
"Care then who list, for I have done.",renaissance_love
And then may chance thee to repent,renaissance_love
The time that thou hast lost and spent,renaissance_love
To cause thy lovers sigh and swoon;,renaissance_love
"Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,",renaissance_love
And wish and want as I have done.,renaissance_love
"Now cease, my lute; this is the last",renaissance_love
"Labour that thou and I shall waste,",renaissance_love
And ended is that we begun.,renaissance_love
Now is this song both sung and past:,renaissance_love
"My lute be still, for I have done.",renaissance_love
"I now think Love is rather deaf than blind,",renaissance_love
For else it could not be,renaissance_love
"That she,",renaissance_love
"Whom I adore so much, should so slight me",renaissance_love
And cast my love behind.,renaissance_love
"I'm sure my language to her was as sweet,",renaissance_love
And every close did meet,renaissance_love
"In sentence of as subtle feet,",renaissance_love
As hath the youngest He,renaissance_love
That sits in shadow of Apollo's tree.,renaissance_love
"O, but my conscious fears,",renaissance_love
"That fly my thoughts between,",renaissance_love
Tell me that she hath seen,renaissance_love
"My hundred of gray hairs,",renaissance_love
Told seven and forty years,renaissance_love
"Read so much waste, as she cannot embrace",renaissance_love
My mountain belly and my rocky face;,renaissance_love
And all these through her eyes have stopp'd her ears.,renaissance_love
"Come live with me and be my love,",renaissance_love
"And we will all the pleasures prove,",renaissance_love
"That Valleys, groves, hills, and fields,",renaissance_love
"Woods, or steepy mountain yields.",renaissance_love
"And we will sit upon the Rocks,",renaissance_love
"Seeing the Shepherds feed their flocks,",renaissance_love
By shallow Rivers to whose falls,renaissance_love
Melodious birds sing Madrigals.,renaissance_love
And I will make thee beds of Roses,renaissance_love
"And a thousand fragrant posies,",renaissance_love
"A cap of flowers, and a kirtle",renaissance_love
Embroidered all with leaves of Myrtle;,renaissance_love
A gown made of the finest wool,renaissance_love
Which from our pretty Lambs we pull;,renaissance_love
"Fair lined slippers for the cold,",renaissance_love
With buckles of the purest gold;,renaissance_love
"A belt of straw and Ivy buds,",renaissance_love
With Coral clasps and Amber studs:,renaissance_love
"And if these pleasures may thee move,",renaissance_love
"Come live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
The Shepherds Swains shall dance and sing,renaissance_love
For thy delight each May-morning:,renaissance_love
"If these delights thy mind may move,",renaissance_love
"Then live with me, and be my love.",renaissance_love
When my grave is broke up again,renaissance_love
"       Some second guest to entertain,",renaissance_love
"       (For graves have learn'd that woman head,",renaissance_love
       To be to more than one a bed),renaissance_love
"                And he that digs it, spies",renaissance_love
"A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,",renaissance_love
"                Will he not let'us alone,",renaissance_love
"And think that there a loving couple lies,",renaissance_love
Who thought that this device might be some way,renaissance_love
"To make their souls, at the last busy day,",renaissance_love
"Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?",renaissance_love
"         If this fall in a time, or land,",renaissance_love
"         Where mis-devotion doth command,",renaissance_love
"         Then he, that digs us up, will bring",renaissance_love
"         Us to the bishop, and the king,",renaissance_love
                To make us relics; then,renaissance_love
"Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I",renaissance_love
                A something else thereby;,renaissance_love
"All women shall adore us, and some men;",renaissance_love
"And since at such time miracles are sought,",renaissance_love
I would have that age by this paper taught,renaissance_love
What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.,renaissance_love
"         First, we lov'd well and faithfully,",renaissance_love
"         Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;",renaissance_love
         Difference of sex no more we knew,renaissance_love
         Than our guardian angels do;,renaissance_love
"                Coming and going, we",renaissance_love
"Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;",renaissance_love
                Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,renaissance_love
"Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free;",renaissance_love
"These miracles we did, but now alas,",renaissance_love
"All measure, and all language, I should pass,",renaissance_love
Should I tell what a miracle she was.,renaissance_love
"Ring out your bells, let mourning shows be spread;",renaissance_love
For Love is dead,renaissance_love
"All love is dead, infected",renaissance_love
With plague of deep disdain;,renaissance_love
"Worth, as nought worth, rejected,",renaissance_love
And Faith fair scorn doth gain.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Weep, neighbours, weep; do you not hear it said",renaissance_love
That Love is dead?,renaissance_love
"His death-bed, peacock's folly;",renaissance_love
His winding-sheet is shame;,renaissance_love
"His will, false-seeming holy;",renaissance_love
"His sole exec'tor, blame.",renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Let dirge be sung and trentals rightly read,",renaissance_love
For Love is dead;,renaissance_love
Sir Wrong his tomb ordaineth,renaissance_love
"My mistress' marble heart,",renaissance_love
"Which epitaph containeth,",renaissance_love
Her eyes were once his dart.,renaissance_love
"From so ungrateful fancy,",renaissance_love
"From such a female franzy,",renaissance_love
"From them that use men thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!",renaissance_love
"Alas, I lie, rage hath this error bred;",renaissance_love
Love is not dead;,renaissance_love
"Love is not dead, but sleepeth",renaissance_love
"In her unmatched mind,",renaissance_love
"Where she his counsel keepeth,",renaissance_love
Till due desert she find.,renaissance_love
"Therefore from so vile fancy,",renaissance_love
"To call such wit a franzy,",renaissance_love
"Who Love can temper thus,",renaissance_love
"Good Lord, deliver us!Rose-cheek'd Laura, come,",renaissance_love
Sing thou smoothly with thy beauty's,renaissance_love
"Silent music, either other",renaissance_love
Sweetly gracing.,renaissance_love
Lovely forms do flow,renaissance_love
From concent divinely framed;,renaissance_love
"Heav'n is music, and thy beauty's",renaissance_love
Birth is heavenly.,renaissance_love
These dull notes we sing,renaissance_love
Discords need for helps to grace them;,renaissance_love
Only beauty purely loving,renaissance_love
"Knows no discord,",renaissance_love
"But still moves delight,",renaissance_love
"Like clear springs renew'd by flowing,",renaissance_love
"Ever perfect, ever in them-",renaissance_love
"Selves eternal.Since so ye please to hear me plain,",renaissance_love
"And that ye do rejoice my smart,",renaissance_love
Me list no lenger to remain,renaissance_love
To such as be so overthwart.,renaissance_love
But cursed be that cruel heart,renaissance_love
Which hath procurd a careless mind,renaissance_love
"For me and mine unfeigned smart,",renaissance_love
And forceth me such faults to find.,renaissance_love
More than too much I am assured,renaissance_love
"Of thine intent, whereto to trust;",renaissance_love
"A speedless proof I have endured,",renaissance_love
And now I leave it to them that lust.,renaissance_love
"My true-love hath my heart and I have his,",renaissance_love
By just exchange one for the other given:,renaissance_love
"I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;",renaissance_love
There never was a bargain better driven.,renaissance_love
His heart in me keeps me and him in one;,renaissance_love
My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:,renaissance_love
"He loves my heart, for once it was his own;",renaissance_love
I cherish his because in me it bides.,renaissance_love
His heart his wound received from my sight;,renaissance_love
My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;,renaissance_love
"For as from me on him his hurt did light,",renaissance_love
"So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:",renaissance_love
"Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,",renaissance_love
My true love hath my heart and I have his.,renaissance_love
"Go and catch a falling star,",renaissance_love
"    Get with child a mandrake root,",renaissance_love
"Tell me where all past years are,",renaissance_love
"    Or who cleft the devil's foot,",renaissance_love
"Teach me to hear mermaids singing,",renaissance_love
"Or to keep off envy's stinging,",renaissance_love
            And find,renaissance_love
            What wind,renaissance_love
Serves to advance an honest mind.,renaissance_love
"If thou be'st born to strange sights,",renaissance_love
"    Things invisible to see,",renaissance_love
"Ride ten thousand days and nights,",renaissance_love
"    Till age snow white hairs on thee,",renaissance_love
"Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,",renaissance_love
"All strange wonders that befell thee,",renaissance_love
"            And swear,",renaissance_love
            No where,renaissance_love
"Lives a woman true, and fair.",renaissance_love
"If thou find'st one, let me know,",renaissance_love
    Such a pilgrimage were sweet;,renaissance_love
"Yet do not, I would not go,",renaissance_love
    Though at next door we might meet;,renaissance_love
"Though she were true, when you met her,",renaissance_love
"And last, till you write your letter,",renaissance_love
            Yet she,renaissance_love
            Will be,renaissance_love
"False, ere I come, to two, or three.",renaissance_love
The student may give either title during the recitation.,renaissance_love
O Mistress mine where are you roaming?,renaissance_love
"O stay and hear, your true love's coming,",renaissance_love
      That can sing both high and low.,renaissance_love
Trip no further pretty sweeting.,renaissance_love
"Journeys end in lovers' meeting,",renaissance_love
      Every wise man's son doth know.,renaissance_love
"What is love, 'tis not hereafter,",renaissance_love
"Present mirth, hath present laughter:",renaissance_love
"      What's to come, is still unsure.",renaissance_love
"In delay there lies no plenty,",renaissance_love
Then come kiss me sweet and twenty:,renaissance_love
      Youth's a stuff will not endure.,renaissance_love
"      Sweetest love, I do not go,",renaissance_love
"         For weariness of thee,",renaissance_love
Nor in hope the world can show,renaissance_love
         A fitter love for me;,renaissance_love
                But since that I,renaissance_love
"Must die at last, 'tis best",renaissance_love
To use myself in jest,renaissance_love
         Thus by feign'd deaths to die.,renaissance_love
"Yesternight the sun went hence,",renaissance_love
         And yet is here today;,renaissance_love
"He hath no desire nor sense,",renaissance_love
         Nor half so short a way:,renaissance_love
"                Then fear not me,",renaissance_love
But believe that I shall make,renaissance_love
"Speedier journeys, since I take",renaissance_love
         More wings and spurs than he.,renaissance_love
"O how feeble is man's power,",renaissance_love
"         That if good fortune fall,",renaissance_love
"Cannot add another hour,",renaissance_love
         Nor a lost hour recall!,renaissance_love
"                But come bad chance,",renaissance_love
"And we join to'it our strength,",renaissance_love
"And we teach it art and length,",renaissance_love
         Itself o'er us to'advance.,renaissance_love
"When thou sigh'st, thou sigh'st not wind,",renaissance_love
         But sigh'st my soul away;,renaissance_love
"When thou weep'st, unkindly kind,",renaissance_love
         My life's blood doth decay.,renaissance_love
                It cannot be,renaissance_love
"That thou lov'st me, as thou say'st,",renaissance_love
"If in thine my life thou waste,",renaissance_love
         That art the best of me.,renaissance_love
Let not thy divining heart,renaissance_love
         Forethink me any ill;,renaissance_love
"Destiny may take thy part,",renaissance_love
         And may thy fears fulfil;,renaissance_love
                But think that we,renaissance_love
Are but turn'd aside to sleep;,renaissance_love
They who one another keep,renaissance_love
"         Alive, ne'er parted be.",renaissance_love
"         Take, oh take those lips away,",renaissance_love
"      That so sweetly were forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And those eyes: the breake of day,",renaissance_love
      Lights that do mislead the Morn;,renaissance_love
"But my kisses bring again, bring again,",renaissance_love
"Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.",renaissance_love
"Drink to me only with thine eyes,",renaissance_love
         And I will pledge with mine;,renaissance_love
"Or leave a kiss but in the cup,",renaissance_love
         And Ill not look for wine.,renaissance_love
The thirst that from the soul doth rise,renaissance_love
         Doth ask a drink divine;,renaissance_love
"But might I of Joves nectar sup,",renaissance_love
         I would not change for thine.,renaissance_love
"I sent thee late a rosy wreath,",renaissance_love
         Not so much honouring thee,renaissance_love
"As giving it a hope, that there",renaissance_love
         It could not withered be.,renaissance_love
"But thou thereon didst only breathe,",renaissance_love
         And sentst it back to me;,renaissance_love
"Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,",renaissance_love
"         Not of itself, but thee.",renaissance_love
         When I consider everything that grows,renaissance_love
"Holds in perfection but a little moment,",renaissance_love
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows,renaissance_love
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;,renaissance_love
"When I perceive that men as plants increase,",renaissance_love
"Cheered and check'd even by the selfsame sky,",renaissance_love
"Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,",renaissance_love
And wear their brave state out of memory;,renaissance_love
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay,renaissance_love
"Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,",renaissance_love
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,renaissance_love
To change your day of youth to sullied night;,renaissance_love
"And all in war with Time for love of you,",renaissance_love
"As he takes from you, I engraft you new.",renaissance_love
"Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,",renaissance_love
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;,renaissance_love
"Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,",renaissance_love
And burn the long-liv'd Phoenix in her blood;,renaissance_love
"Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,",renaissance_love
"And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,",renaissance_love
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;,renaissance_love
But I forbid thee one more heinous crime:,renaissance_love
"O, carve not with the hours my love's fair brow,",renaissance_love
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen!,renaissance_love
Him in thy course untainted do allow,renaissance_love
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.,renaissance_love
"Yet do thy worst, old Time! Despite thy wrong",renaissance_love
My love shall in my verse ever live young.,renaissance_love
Let those who are in favour with their stars,renaissance_love
"Of public honour and proud titles boast,",renaissance_love
"Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,",renaissance_love
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.,renaissance_love
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread,renaissance_love
"But as the marigold at the sun's eye,",renaissance_love
"And in themselves their pride lies buried,",renaissance_love
For at a frown they in their glory die.,renaissance_love
"The painful warrior famoused for fight,",renaissance_love
"After a thousand victories once foil'd,",renaissance_love
"Is from the book of honour razed quite,",renaissance_love
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:,renaissance_love
"Then happy I, that love and am beloved",renaissance_love
Where I may not remove nor be removed.,renaissance_love
"When, in disgrace with fortune and mens eyes,",renaissance_love
"I all alone beweep my outcast state,",renaissance_love
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",renaissance_love
"And look upon myself and curse my fate,",renaissance_love
"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",renaissance_love
"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",renaissance_love
"Desiring this mans art and that mans scope,",renaissance_love
With what I most enjoy contented least;,renaissance_love
"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",renaissance_love
"Haply I think on thee, and then my state,",renaissance_love
(Like to the lark at break of day arising,renaissance_love
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heavens gate;,renaissance_love
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,renaissance_love
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,renaissance_love
       When to the sessions of sweet silent thought,renaissance_love
"I summon up remembrance of things past,",renaissance_love
"I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,",renaissance_love
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:,renaissance_love
"Then can I drown an eye, unus'd to flow,",renaissance_love
"For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,",renaissance_love
"And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,",renaissance_love
And moan th' expense of many a vanish'd sight;,renaissance_love
"Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,",renaissance_love
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er,renaissance_love
"The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,",renaissance_love
Which I new pay as if not paid before.,renaissance_love
"But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,",renaissance_love
"All losses are restor'd, and sorrows end.",renaissance_love
"If thou survive my well-contented day,",renaissance_love
"When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,",renaissance_love
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey,renaissance_love
"These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,",renaissance_love
"Compare them with the bettering of the time,",renaissance_love
"And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,",renaissance_love
"Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,",renaissance_love
Exceeded by the height of happier men.,renaissance_love
O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:,renaissance_love
"Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
To march in ranks of better equipage:
But since he died and poets better prove,
Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.",renaissance_love
Full many a glorious morning have I seen,renaissance_love
"Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,",renaissance_love
"Kissing with golden face the meadows green,",renaissance_love
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;,renaissance_love
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride,renaissance_love
With ugly rack on his celestial face,renaissance_love
"And from the forlorn world his visage hide,",renaissance_love
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace.,renaissance_love
Even so my sun one early morn did shine,renaissance_love
With all-triumphant splendour on my brow;,renaissance_love
"But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;",renaissance_love
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.,renaissance_love
Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;,renaissance_love
Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.,renaissance_love
"What is your substance, whereof are you made,",renaissance_love
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?,renaissance_love
"Since every one hath, every one, one shade,",renaissance_love
"And you, but one, can every shadow lend.",renaissance_love
"Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit",renaissance_love
Is poorly imitated after you;,renaissance_love
"On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,",renaissance_love
And you in Grecian tires are painted new.,renaissance_love
Speak of the spring and foison of the year:,renaissance_love
"The one doth shadow of your beauty show,",renaissance_love
The other as your bounty doth appear;,renaissance_love
And you in every blessed shape we know.,renaissance_love
"    In all external grace you have some part,",renaissance_love
"    But you like none, none you, for constant heart.",renaissance_love
    When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd,renaissance_love
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;,renaissance_love
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd,renaissance_love
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;,renaissance_love
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain,renaissance_love
"Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,",renaissance_love
"And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,",renaissance_love
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;,renaissance_love
"When I have seen such interchange of state,",renaissance_love
Or state itself confounded to decay;,renaissance_love
"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,",renaissance_love
That Time will come and take my love away.,renaissance_love
"This thought is as a death, which cannot choose",renaissance_love
But weep to have that which it fears to lose.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, for restful death I cry,",renaissance_love
"As, to behold desert a beggar born,",renaissance_love
"And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,",renaissance_love
"And purest faith unhappily forsworn,",renaissance_love
"And gilded honour shamefully misplac'd,",renaissance_love
"And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,",renaissance_love
"And right perfection wrongfully disgrac'd,",renaissance_love
"And strength by limping sway disabled,",renaissance_love
"And art made tongue-tied by authority,",renaissance_love
"And folly, doctor-like, controlling skill,",renaissance_love
"And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,",renaissance_love
And captive good attending captain ill.,renaissance_love
"Tir'd with all these, from these would I be gone,",renaissance_love
"Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.",renaissance_love
No longer mourn for me when I am dead,renaissance_love
Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell,renaissance_love
Give warning to the world that I am fled,renaissance_love
From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; ,renaissance_love
"Nay, if you read this line, remember not",renaissance_love
"The hand that writ it; for I love you so, ",renaissance_love
"That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, ",renaissance_love
If thinking on me then should make you woe.,renaissance_love
"O, if (I say) you look upon this verse, ",renaissance_love
"When I (perhaps) compounded am with clay,",renaissance_love
"Do not so much as my poor name rehearse,",renaissance_love
"But let your love even with my life decay,",renaissance_love
"Lest the wise world should look into your moan, ",renaissance_love
And mock you with me after I am gone.,renaissance_love
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,renaissance_love
"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang",renaissance_love
"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,",renaissance_love
"Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the twilight of such day,renaissance_love
"As after sunset fadeth in the west,",renaissance_love
"Which by and by black night doth take away,",renaissance_love
"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.",renaissance_love
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire,renaissance_love
"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,",renaissance_love
"As the death-bed whereon it must expire,",renaissance_love
Consum'd with that which it was nourish'd by.,renaissance_love
"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,",renaissance_love
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.,renaissance_love
"Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul",renaissance_love
"Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,",renaissance_love
"Can yet the lease of my true love control,",renaissance_love
Suppos'd as forfeit to a confin'd doom.,renaissance_love
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd,renaissance_love
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;,renaissance_love
Incertainties now crown themselves assur'd,renaissance_love
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.,renaissance_love
Now with the drops of this most balmy time,renaissance_love
"My love looks fresh, and Death to me subscribes,",renaissance_love
"Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,",renaissance_love
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes;,renaissance_love
"And thou in this shalt find thy monument,",renaissance_love
When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.,renaissance_love
"Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",renaissance_love
"And made myself a motley to the view,",renaissance_love
"Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,",renaissance_love
Made old offences of affections new.,renaissance_love
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth,renaissance_love
"Askance and strangely: but, by all above,",renaissance_love
"These blenches gave my heart another youth,",renaissance_love
And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.,renaissance_love
"Now all is done, have what shall have no end!",renaissance_love
"Mine appetite, I never more will grind",renaissance_love
"On newer proof, to try an older friend,",renaissance_love
"A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.",renaissance_love
"Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,",renaissance_love
Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.,renaissance_love
Let me not to the marriage of true minds,renaissance_love
Admit impediments. Love is not love,renaissance_love
"Which alters when it alteration finds,",renaissance_love
Or bends with the remover to remove.,renaissance_love
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark,renaissance_love
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;,renaissance_love
"It is the star to every wand'ring bark,",renaissance_love
"Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.",renaissance_love
"Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks",renaissance_love
Within his bending sickle's compass come;,renaissance_love
"Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,",renaissance_love
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.,renaissance_love
"If this be error and upon me prov'd,",renaissance_love
"I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.",renaissance_love
Th' expense of spirit in a waste of shame,renaissance_love
"Is lust in action; and till action, lust",renaissance_love
"Is perjured, murd'rous, bloody, full of blame,",renaissance_love
"Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,",renaissance_love
"Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight,",renaissance_love
"Past reason hunted; and, no sooner had",renaissance_love
Past reason hated as a swallowed bait,renaissance_love
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;,renaissance_love
"Mad in pursuit and in possession so,",renaissance_love
"Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;",renaissance_love
"A bliss in proof and proved, a very woe;",renaissance_love
"Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.",renaissance_love
    All this the world well knows; yet none knows well,renaissance_love
    To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.,renaissance_love
    My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;,renaissance_love
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;,renaissance_love
"If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;",renaissance_love
"If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.",renaissance_love
"I have seen roses damasked, red and white,",renaissance_love
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;,renaissance_love
And in some perfumes is there more delight,renaissance_love
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.,renaissance_love
"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know",renaissance_love

But all is turned thorough my gentleness,renaissance_love
Into a strange fashion of forsaking;,renaissance_love

My body in tempest her succour to embrace.,renaissance_love
"The body dead, the sprite had his desire,",renaissance_love

"Thy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show",renaissance_love
"   To move, but doth, if the other do.",renaissance_love
"And though it in the center sit,",renaissance_love
"   Yet when the other far doth roam,",renaissance_love
"It leans and hearkens after it,",renaissance_love
"   And grows erect, as that comes home.",renaissance_love
"Such wilt thou be to me, who must,",renaissance_love
"   Like th' other foot, obliquely run;",renaissance_love
"Thy firmness makes my circle just,",renaissance_love
   And makes me end where I begun.,renaissance_love
   Let me pour forth,renaissance_love
"My tears before thy face, whilst I stay here,",renaissance_love
"For thy face coins them, and thy stamp they bear,",renaissance_love
"And by this mintage they are something worth,",renaissance_love
         For thus they be,renaissance_love
         Pregnant of thee;,renaissance_love
"Fruits of much grief they are, emblems of more,",renaissance_love
"When a tear falls, that thou falls which it bore,",renaissance_love
"So thou and I are nothing then, when on a diverse shore.",renaissance_love
         On a round ball,renaissance_love
"A workman that hath copies by, can lay",renaissance_love
"An Europe, Afric, and an Asia,",renaissance_love
"And quickly make that, which was nothing, all;",renaissance_love
         So doth each tear,renaissance_love
"         Which thee doth wear,",renaissance_love
"A globe, yea world, by that impression grow,",renaissance_love
Till thy tears mix'd with mine do overflow,renaissance_love
"This world; by waters sent from thee, my heaven dissolved so.",renaissance_love
"         O more than moon,",renaissance_love
"Draw not up seas to drown me in thy sphere,",renaissance_love
"Weep me not dead, in thine arms, but forbear",renaissance_love
To teach the sea what it may do too soon;,renaissance_love
         Let not the wind,renaissance_love
"         Example find,",renaissance_love
To do me more harm than it purposeth;,renaissance_love
"Since thou and I sigh one another's breath,",renaissance_love
"Whoe'er sighs most is cruellest, and hastes the other's death.",renaissance_love
What needeth these threnning words and wasted wind?,renaissance_love
All this cannot make me restore my prey.,renaissance_love
"To rob your good, iwis, is not my mind,",renaissance_love
Nor causeless your fair hand did I display.,renaissance_love
Let love be judge or else whom next we meet,renaissance_love
That may both hear what you and I can say:,renaissance_love
"She took from me an heart, and I a glove from her.",renaissance_love
"Let us see now if th'one be worth th'other.What should I say,",renaissance_love
"Since faith is dead,",renaissance_love
And truth away,renaissance_love
From you is fled?,renaissance_love
Should I be led,renaissance_love
With doubleness?,renaissance_love
"Nay, nay, mistress!",renaissance_love
"I promised you,",renaissance_love
"And you promised me,",renaissance_love
To be as true,renaissance_love
As I would be.,renaissance_love
But since I see,renaissance_love
"Your double heart,",renaissance_love
Farewell my part!,renaissance_love
Though for to take,renaissance_love
"It is not my mind,",renaissance_love
But to forsake,renaissance_love
[One so unkind],renaissance_love
"And as I find,",renaissance_love
So will I trust:,renaissance_love
"Farewell, unjust!",renaissance_love
Can ye say nay?,renaissance_love
But you said,renaissance_love
That I alway,renaissance_love
Should be obeyed?,renaissance_love
And thus betrayed,renaissance_love
Or that I wiste,renaissance_love
"Farewell, unkissed.",renaissance_love
"When thou must home to shades of underground,",renaissance_love
"And there arriv'd, a new admired guest,",renaissance_love
"The beauteous spirits do engirt thee round,",renaissance_love
"White Iope, blithe Helen, and the rest,",renaissance_love
To hear the stories of thy finish'd love,renaissance_love
From that smooth tongue whose music hell can move;,renaissance_love
"Then wilt thou speak of banqueting delights,",renaissance_love
"Of masques and revels which sweet youth did make,",renaissance_love
"Of tourneys and great challenges of knights,",renaissance_love
And all these triumphs for thy beauty's sake:,renaissance_love
"When thou hast told these honours done to thee,",renaissance_love
"Then tell, O tell, how thou didst murder me.",renaissance_love
"Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,",renaissance_love
"But as for me, helas, I may no more.",renaissance_love
"The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,",renaissance_love
I am of them that farthest cometh behind.,renaissance_love
Yet may I by no means my wearied mind,renaissance_love
"Draw from the deer, but as she fleeth afore",renaissance_love
"Fainting I follow. I leave off therefore,",renaissance_love
Sithens in a net I seek to hold the wind.,renaissance_love
"Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,",renaissance_love
As well as I may spend his time in vain.,renaissance_love
And graven with diamonds in letters plain,renaissance_love
"There is written, her fair neck round about:",renaissance_love
"Noli me tangere, for Caesar's I am,",renaissance_love
"And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.",renaissance_love
"Ye old mule that think yourself so fair,",renaissance_love
"Leave off with craft your beauty to repair,",renaissance_love
"For it is true, without any fable,",renaissance_love
No man setteth more by riding in your saddle.,renaissance_love
Too much travail so do your train appair.,renaissance_love
        Ye old mule,renaissance_love
"With false savour though you deceive th'air,",renaissance_love
Whoso taste you shall well perceive your lair,renaissance_love
Savoureth somewhat of a Kappurs stable.,renaissance_love
        Ye old mule,renaissance_love
"Ye must now serve to market and to fair,",renaissance_love
"All for the burden, for panniers a pair.",renaissance_love
"For since gray hairs been powdered in your sable,",renaissance_love
"The thing ye seek for, you must yourself enable",renaissance_love
"To purchase it by payment and by prayer,",renaissance_love
Ye old mule.,renaissance_love
