The day before Curl Trenary,modern_love
Swore out a warrant through Justice Arnett,modern_love
For stealing hogs.,modern_love
But that's not the reason he turned a soldier.,modern_love
He caught me running with Lucius Atherton.,modern_love
We quarreled and I told him never again,modern_love
To cross my path.,modern_love
Then he stole the hogs and went to the war,modern_love
Back of every soldier is a woman.He protested all his life long,modern_love
The newspapers lied about him villainously;,modern_love
"That he was not at fault for Minerva's fall,",modern_love
But only tried to help her.,modern_love
Poor soul so sunk in sin he could not see,modern_love
"That even trying to help her, as he called it,",modern_love
He had broken the law human and divine.,modern_love
"Passers by, an ancient admonition to you:",modern_love
"If your ways would be ways of pleasantness,",modern_love
"And all your pathways peace,",modern_love
Love God and keep his commandments.,modern_love
"And lights were paling out of the West,",modern_love
"You would come hither, and bend your head,",modern_love
And I would lay my head on your breast;,modern_love
"And you would murmur tender words,",modern_love
"Forgiving me, because you were dead:",modern_love
"Nor would you rise and hasten away,",modern_love
"Though you have the will of wild birds,",modern_love
But know your hair was bound and wound,modern_love
About the stars and moon and sun:,modern_love
"O would, beloved, that you lay",modern_love
"Under the dock-leaves in the ground,",modern_love
"While lights were paling one by one.Never give all the heart, for love",modern_love
Will hardly seem worth thinking of,modern_love
To passionate women if it seem,modern_love
"Certain, and they never dream",modern_love
That it fades out from kiss to kiss;,modern_love
For everything thats lovely is,modern_love
"But a brief, dreamy, kind delight.",modern_love
"O never give the heart outright,",modern_love
"For they, for all smooth lips can say,",modern_love
Have given their hearts up to the play.,modern_love
And who could play it well enough,modern_love
If deaf and dumb and blind with love?,modern_love
"He that made this knows all the cost,",modern_love
For he gave all his heart and lost.Why should I blame her that she filled my days,modern_love
"With misery, or that she would of late",modern_love
"Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",modern_love
"Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",modern_love
Had they but courage equal to desire?,modern_love
What could have made her peaceful with a mind,modern_love
"That nobleness made simple as a fire,",modern_love
"With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",modern_love
"That is not natural in an age like this,",modern_love
Being high and solitary and most stern?,modern_love
"Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",modern_love
Was there another Troy for her to burn?Some may have blamed you that you took away,modern_love
The verses that could move them on the day,modern_love
"When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind",modern_love
"With lightning, you went from me, and I could find",modern_love
"Nothing to make a song about but kings,",modern_love
"Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things",modern_love
That were like memories of youbut now,modern_love
"We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;",modern_love
"And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,",modern_love
"Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.",modern_love
"But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,",modern_love
"My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone. Shy one, shy one,",modern_love
"Shy one of my heart,",modern_love
She moves in the firelight,modern_love
Pensively apart.,modern_love
"She carries in the dishes,",modern_love
And lays them in a row.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
With her would I go.,modern_love
"She carries in the candles,",modern_love
"And lights the curtained room,",modern_love
Shy in the doorway,modern_love
And shy in the gloom;,modern_love
"And shy as a rabbit,",modern_love
Helpful and shy.,modern_love
To an isle in the water,modern_love
"With her would I fly.I feel the spring far off, far off,",modern_love
"The faint, far scent of bud and leaf",modern_love
"Oh, how can spring take heart to come",modern_love
"To a world in grief,",modern_love
Deep grief?,modern_love
"The sun turns north, the days grow long,",modern_love
Later the evening star grows bright,modern_love
How can the daylight linger on,modern_love
"For men to fight,",modern_love
Still fight?,modern_love
"The grass is waking in the ground,",modern_love
Soon it will rise and blow in waves,modern_love
How can it have the heart to sway,modern_love
"Over the graves,",modern_love
New graves?,modern_love
Under the boughs where lovers walked,modern_love
The apple-blooms will shed their breath,modern_love
But what of all the lovers now,modern_love
"Parted by Death,",modern_love
"Grey Death?Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;",modern_love
Watching the candle guttering in the draught;,modern_love
"Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily",modern_love
"Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed",modern_love
"With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,",modern_love
"All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;",modern_love
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;,modern_love
"Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,",modern_love
"Though in a picture only, a common cheap",modern_love
"Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some",modern_love
waiting on Dicky-bird to peep,modern_love
Out of the handkerchief that is his home,modern_love
"But he's so shy! And some with bright looks, calling",modern_love
"Delight across the miles of land and sea,",modern_love
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling,modern_love
Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.,modern_love
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O,modern_love
"The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! ",modern_love
"Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow",modern_love
"Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.",modern_love
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token,modern_love
"Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,",modern_love
"Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,",modern_love
"A girl who better had not been beloved.I went out to the hazel wood,",modern_love
"Because a fire was in my head,",modern_love
"And cut and peeled a hazel wand,",modern_love
And hooked a berry to a thread;,modern_love
"And when white moths were on the wing,",modern_love
"And moth-like stars were flickering out,",modern_love
I dropped the berry in a stream,modern_love
And caught a little silver trout.,modern_love
When I had laid it on the floor,modern_love
"I went to blow the fire a-flame,",modern_love
"But something rustled on the floor,",modern_love
And someone called me by my name:,modern_love
It had become a glimmering girl,modern_love
With apple blossom in her hair,modern_love
Who called me by my name and ran,modern_love
And faded through the brightening air.,modern_love
Though I am old with wandering,modern_love
"Through hollow lands and hilly lands,",modern_love
"I will find out where she has gone,",modern_love
And kiss her lips and take her hands;,modern_love
"And walk among long dappled grass,",modern_love
"And pluck till time and times are done,",modern_love
"The silver apples of the moon,",modern_love
The golden apples of the sun.Now that I know,modern_love
That passion warms little,modern_love
"Of flesh in the mold,",modern_love
"And treasure is brittle,",modern_love
Ill lie here and learn,modern_love
"How, over their ground,",modern_love
Trees make a long shadow,modern_love
And a light sound.,modern_love
"The stars are hiding now,",modern_love
"And frowning on the world, love,",modern_love
Night bares her sable brow.,modern_love
"The snow is on the ground, love,",modern_love
And cold and keen the air is.,modern_love
"Im singing here to you, love;",modern_love
Youre dreaming there in Paris.,modern_love
"But this is Natures law, love,",modern_love
"Though just it may not seem,",modern_love
"That men should wake to sing, love;",modern_love
While maidens sleep and dream.,modern_love
"Them care may not molest, love,",modern_love
"Nor stir them from their slumbers,",modern_love
"Though midnight find the swain, love.",modern_love
Still halting oer his numbers.,modern_love
"I watch the rosy dawn, love,",modern_love
"Come stealing up the east,",modern_love
"While all things round rejoice, love,",modern_love
That Night her reign has ceased.,modern_love
"The lark will soon be heard, love,",modern_love
And on his way be winging;,modern_love
"When Natures poets, wake, love,",modern_love
"Why should a man be singing?Thou art my lute, by thee I sing,",modern_love
My being is attuned to thee.,modern_love
"Thou settest all my words a-wing,",modern_love
And meltest me to melody.,modern_love
"Thou art my life, by thee I live,",modern_love
From thee proceed the joys I know;,modern_love
"Sweetheart, thy hand has power to give",modern_love
The meed of lovethe cup of woe.,modern_love
"Thou art my love, by thee I lead",modern_love
"My soul the paths of light along,",modern_love
"From vale to vale, from mead to mead,",modern_love
And home it in the hills of song.,modern_love
"My song, my soul, my life, my all,",modern_love
"Why need I pray or make my plea,",modern_love
Since my petition cannot fall;,modern_love
For Im already one with thee!Wine comes in at the mouth,modern_love
And love comes in at the eye;,modern_love
Thats all we shall know for truth,modern_love
Before we grow old and die.,modern_love
"I lift the glass to my mouth,",modern_love
"I look at you, and I sigh.Bilbea, I was in Babylon on Saturday night.",modern_love
I saw nothing of you anywhere.,modern_love
"I was at the old place and the other girls were there,",modern_love
But no Bilbea.,modern_love
Have you gone to another house? or city?,modern_love
Why dont you write?,modern_love
I was sorry. I walked home half-sick.,modern_love
Tell me how it goes.,modern_love
Send me some kind of a letter.,modern_love
"And take care of yourself.How much do you love me, a million bushels?",modern_love
"Oh, a lot more than that, Oh, a lot more.",modern_love
And tomorrow maybe only half a bushel?,modern_love
Tomorrow maybe not even a half a bushel.,modern_love
And is this your heart arithmetic?,modern_love
This is the way the wind measures the weather.,modern_love
When the world turns completely upside down,modern_love
You say well emigrate to the Eastern Shore,modern_love
Aboard a river-boat from Baltimore;,modern_love
"Well live among wild peach trees, miles from town,",modern_love
"Youll wear a coonskin cap, and I a gown",modern_love
"Homespun, dyed butternuts dark gold color.",modern_love
"Lost, like your lotus-eating ancestor,",modern_love
Well swim in milk and honey till we drown.,modern_love
"The winter will be short, the summer long,",modern_love
"The autumn amber-hued, sunny and hot,",modern_love
Tasting of cider and of scuppernong;,modern_love
"All seasons sweet, but autumn best of all.",modern_love
The squirrels in their silver fur will fall,modern_love
"Like falling leaves, like fruit, before your shot.",modern_love
The autumn frosts will lie upon the grass,modern_love
Like bloom on grapes of purple-brown and gold.,modern_love
The misted early mornings will be cold;,modern_love
The little puddles will be roofed with glass.,modern_love
"The sun, which burns from copper into brass,",modern_love
"Melts these at noon, and makes the boys unfold",modern_love
Their knitted mufflers; full as they can hold,modern_love
Fat pockets dribble chestnuts as they pass.,modern_love
"Peaches grow wild, and pigs can live in clover;",modern_love
A barrel of salted herrings lasts a year;,modern_love
The spring begins before the winters over.,modern_love
By February you may find the skins,modern_love
Of garter snakes and water moccasins,modern_love
"Dwindled and harsh, dead-white and cloudy-clear.",modern_love
When April pours the colors of a shell,modern_love
"Upon the hills, when every little creek",modern_love
Is shot with silver from the Chesapeake,modern_love
"In shoals new-minted by the ocean swell,",modern_love
"When strawberries go begging, and the sleek",modern_love
"Blue plums lie open to the blackbirds beak,",modern_love
We shall live well  we shall live very well.,modern_love
The months between the cherries and the peaches,modern_love
Are brimming cornucopias which spill,modern_love
"Fruits red and purple, sombre-bloomed and black;",modern_love
"Then, down rich fields and frosty river beaches",modern_love
"Well trample bright persimmons, while you kill",modern_love
"Bronze partridge, speckled quail, and canvasback.",modern_love
Down to the Puritan marrow of my bones,modern_love
Theres something in this richness that I hate.,modern_love
"I love the look, austere, immaculate,",modern_love
Of landscapes drawn in pearly monotones.,modern_love
Theres something in my very blood that owns,modern_love
"Bare hills, cold silver on a sky of slate,",modern_love
"A thread of water, churned to milky spate",modern_love
Streaming through slanted pastures fenced with stones.,modern_love
"I love those skies, thin blue or snowy gray,",modern_love
"Those fields sparse-planted, rendering meagre sheaves;",modern_love
"That spring, briefer than apple-blossoms breath,",modern_love
"Summer, so much too beautiful to stay,",modern_love
"Swift autumn, like a bonfire of leaves,",modern_love
"And sleepy winter, like the sleep of death.",modern_love
"The eyes of the very learned British Museum assistant.We sat together at one summers end,",modern_love
"That beautiful mild woman, your close friend,   ",modern_love
"And you and I, and talked of poetry.",modern_love
"I said, A line will take us hours maybe;",modern_love
"Yet if it does not seem a moments thought,   ",modern_love
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   ,modern_love
Better go down upon your marrow-bones   ,modern_love
"And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones   ",modern_love
"Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;   ",modern_love
For to articulate sweet sounds together,modern_love
"Is to work harder than all these, and yet   ",modern_love
Be thought an idler by the noisy set,modern_love
"Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen   ",modern_love
The martyrs call the world.,modern_love
That beautiful mild woman for whose sake   ,modern_love
Theres many a one shall find out all heartache   ,modern_love
On finding that her voice is sweet and low   ,modern_love
"Replied, To be born woman is to know",modern_love
Although they do not talk of it at school,modern_love
That we must labour to be beautiful.,modern_love
"I said, Its certain there is no fine thing   ",modern_love
Since Adams fall but needs much labouring.,modern_love
There have been lovers who thought love should be   ,modern_love
So much compounded of high courtesy   ,modern_love
That they would sigh and quote with learned looks   ,modern_love
Precedents out of beautiful old books;   ,modern_love
Yet now it seems an idle trade enough.,modern_love
We sat grown quiet at the name of love;   ,modern_love
"We saw the last embers of daylight die,   ",modern_love
And in the trembling blue-green of the sky   ,modern_love
"A moon, worn as if it had been a shell   ",modern_love
Washed by times waters as they rose and fell   ,modern_love
About the stars and broke in days and years.,modern_love
I had a thought for no ones but your ears:   ,modern_love
"That you were beautiful, and that I strove   ",modern_love
To love you in the old high way of love;,modern_love
"That it had all seemed happy, and yet wed grown   ",modern_love
"As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,",modern_love
"No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone",modern_love
The Southern Cross takes night,modern_love
"And lifts her girdles from her, one by one",modern_love
"High, cool,",modern_love
wide from the slowly smoldering fire,modern_love
"Of lower heavens,",modern_love
vaporous scars!,modern_love
Eve! Magdalene!,modern_love
"or Mary, you?",modern_love
Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.,modern_love
"O simian Venus, homeless Eve,",modern_love
"Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve",modern_love
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;,modern_love
Finally to answer all within one grave!,modern_love
"And this long wake of phosphor,",modern_love
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!,modern_love
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell,modern_love
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision,modern_love
"The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.",modern_love
I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross,modern_love
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.,modern_love
It is blood to remember; it is fire,modern_love
To stammer back . . . It is,modern_love
Godyour namelessness. And the wash,modern_love
All night the water combed you with black,modern_love
"Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.",modern_love
"Water rattled that stinging coil, your",modern_love
"Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.",modern_love
"Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!",modern_love
"The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.",modern_love
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.,modern_love
my love and I did meet;,modern_love
She passed the salley gardens,modern_love
with little snow-white feet.,modern_love
"She bid me take love easy,",modern_love
as the leaves grow on the tree;,modern_love
"But I, being young and foolish,",modern_love
with her would not agree.,modern_love
In a field by the river,modern_love
"my love and I did stand,",modern_love
And on my leaning shoulder,modern_love
she laid her snow-white hand.,modern_love
"She bid me take life easy,",modern_love
as the grass grows on the weirs;,modern_love
"But I was young and foolish,",modern_love
and now am full of tears.,modern_love
"You dweller in the dark cabin,",modern_love
"To whom the watermelon is always purple,   ",modern_love
"Whose garden is wind and moon,",modern_love
"Of the two dreams, night and day,",modern_love
"What lover, what dreamer, would choose   ",modern_love
The one obscured by sleep?,modern_love
Here is the plantain by your door   ,modern_love
And the best cock of red feather   ,modern_love
That crew before the clocks.,modern_love
"A feme may come, leaf-green,   ",modern_love
Whose coming may give revel   ,modern_love
"Beyond revelries of sleep,",modern_love
"Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   ",modern_love
"So that the sun may speckle,   ",modern_love
While it creaks hail.,modern_love
"You dweller in the dark cabin,   ",modern_love
"Rise, since rising will not waken,   ",modern_love
"And hail, cry hail, cry hail.",modern_love
Come when the nights are bright with stars,modern_love
Or come when the moon is mellow;,modern_love
Come when the sun his golden bars,modern_love
Drops on the hay-field yellow.,modern_love
"Come in the twilight soft and gray,",modern_love
"Come in the night or come in the day,",modern_love
"Come, O love, wheneer you may,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
"You are sweet, O Love, dear Love,",modern_love
You are soft as the nesting dove.,modern_love
Come to my heart and bring it to rest,modern_love
As the bird flies home to its welcome nest.,modern_love
Come when my heart is full of grief,modern_love
Or when my heart is merry;,modern_love
Come with the falling of the leaf,modern_love
Or with the reddning cherry.,modern_love
"Come when the years first blossom blows,",modern_love
"Come when the summer gleams and glows,",modern_love
"Come with the winters drifting snows,",modern_love
"And you are welcome, welcome.",modern_love
While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead,modern_love
"I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.",modern_love
"You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,",modern_love
"You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.",modern_love
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:,modern_love
"Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.",modern_love
At fourteen I married My Lord you.,modern_love
"I never laughed, being bashful.",modern_love
"Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.",modern_love
"Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.",modern_love
"At fifteen I stopped scowling,",modern_love
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours,modern_love
"Forever and forever, and forever.",modern_love
Why should I climb the look out?,modern_love
At sixteen you departed,modern_love
"You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,",modern_love
And you have been gone five months.,modern_love
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.,modern_love
You dragged your feet when you went out.,modern_love
"By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,",modern_love
Too deep to clear them away!,modern_love
"The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.",modern_love
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August,modern_love
Over the grass in the West garden;,modern_love
They hurt me.,modern_love
I grow older.,modern_love
"If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,",modern_love
"Please let me know beforehand,",modern_love
And I will come out to meet you,modern_love
"As far as Cho-fu-Sa.Since there is no escape, since at the end",modern_love
"My body will be utterly destroyed,",modern_love
"This hand I love as I have loved a friend,",modern_love
"This body I tended, wept with and enjoyed;",modern_love
Since there is no escape even for me,modern_love
Who love life with a love too sharp to bear:,modern_love
"The scent of orchards in the rain, the sea",modern_love
And hours alone too still and sure for prayer,modern_love
"Since darkness waits for me, then all the more",modern_love
Let me go down as waves sweep to the shore,modern_love
"In pride, and let me sing with my last breath;",modern_love
In these few hours of light I lift my head;,modern_love
Life is my loverI shall leave the dead,modern_love
If there is any way to baffle death.,modern_love
"Too high, too high to pluck",modern_love
My heart shall swing.,modern_love
"A fruit no bee shall suck,",modern_love
No wasp shall sting.,modern_love
If on some night of cold,modern_love
It falls to ground,modern_love
In apple-leaves of gold,modern_love
Ill wrap it round.,modern_love
And I shall seal it up,modern_love
"With spice and salt,",modern_love
"In a carven silver cup,",modern_love
In a deep vault.,modern_love
Before my eyes are blind,modern_love
"And my lips mute,",modern_love
I must eat core and rind,modern_love
Of that same fruit.,modern_love
Before my heart is dust,modern_love
"At the end of all,",modern_love
"Eat it I must, I must",modern_love
Were it bitter gall.,modern_love
But I shall keep it sweet,modern_love
By some strange art;,modern_love
Wild honey I shall eat,modern_love
When I eat my heart.,modern_love
O honey cool and chaste,modern_love
As clovers breath!,modern_love
Sweet Heaven I shall taste,modern_love
Before my death.When the first dark had fallen around them,modern_love
"And the leaves were weary of praise,",modern_love
In the clear silence Beauty found them,modern_love
And shewed them all her ways.,modern_love
In the high noon of the heavenly garden,modern_love
"Where the angels sunned with the birds,",modern_love
"Beauty, before their hearts could harden,",modern_love
Had taught them heavenly words.,modern_love
When they fled in the burning weather,modern_love
"And nothing dawned but a dream,",modern_love
Beauty fasted their hands together,modern_love
And cooled them at her stream.,modern_love
"And when day wearied and night grew stronger,",modern_love
"And they slept as the beautiful must,",modern_love
"Then she bided a little longer,",modern_love
"And blossomed from their dust.My love looks like a girl to-night,",modern_love
But she is old.,modern_love
The plaits that lie along her pillow,modern_love
"Are not gold,",modern_love
"But threaded with filigree silver,",modern_love
And uncanny cold.,modern_love
"She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",modern_love
"Is smooth and fair,",modern_love
"Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",modern_love
She sleeps a rare,modern_love
"Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",modern_love
"Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",modern_love
Of perfect things.,modern_love
"She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",modern_love
And her dead mouth sings,modern_love
"By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings.The jester walked in the garden:",modern_love
The garden had fallen still;,modern_love
He bade his soul rise upward,modern_love
And stand on her window-sill.,modern_love
"It rose in a straight blue garment,",modern_love
When owls began to call:,modern_love
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking,modern_love
Of a quiet and light footfall;,modern_love
But the young queen would not listen;,modern_love
She rose in her pale night-gown;,modern_love
She drew in the heavy casement,modern_love
And pushed the latches down.,modern_love
"He bade his heart go to her,",modern_love
When the owls called out no more;,modern_love
In a red and quivering garment,modern_love
It sang to her through the door.,modern_love
It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming,modern_love
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;,modern_love
But she took up her fan from the table,modern_love
And waved it off on the air.,modern_love
"'I have cap and bells, he pondered,",modern_love
'I will send them to her and die;,modern_love
And when the morning whitened,modern_love
He left them where she went by.,modern_love
"She laid them upon her bosom,",modern_love
"Under a cloud of her hair,",modern_love
And her red lips sang them a love-song,modern_love
Till stars grew out of the air.,modern_love
"She opened her door and her window,",modern_love
"And the heart and the soul came through,",modern_love
"To her right hand came the red one,",modern_love
To her left hand came the blue.,modern_love
"They set up a noise like crickets,",modern_love
"A chattering wise and sweet,",modern_love
And her hair was a folded flower,modern_love
"And the quiet of love in her feet.What large, dark hands are those at the window",modern_love
"Lifted, grasping the golden light",modern_love
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves,modern_love
To my heart's delight?,modern_love
"Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,",modern_love
In the west I see a redness come,modern_love
Over the evening's burning breast ,modern_love
Tis the wound of love goes home!,modern_love
The woodbine creeps abroad,modern_love
Calling low to her lover:,modern_love
The sun-lit flirt who all the day,modern_love
Has poised above her lips in play,modern_love
"And stolen kisses, shallow and gay",modern_love
"Of pollen, now has gone away",modern_love
"She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,",modern_love
And when above her his broad wings hover,modern_love
Then her bright breast she will uncover,modern_love
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.,modern_love
"Into the yellow, evening glow",modern_love
"Saunters a man from the farm below,",modern_love
"Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed",modern_love
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.,modern_love
The bird lies warm against the wall.,modern_love
She glances quick her startled eyes,modern_love
"Towards him, then she turns away",modern_love
"Her small head, making warm display",modern_love
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway,modern_love
"Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,",modern_love
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies,modern_love
In one blue stoop from out the sties,modern_love
Into the evening's empty hall.,modern_love
"Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes",modern_love
"Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,",modern_love
"Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,",modern_love
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.,modern_love
"The rabbit presses back her ears,",modern_love
"Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes",modern_love
And crouches low: then with wild spring,modern_love
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming,modern_love
"To be choked back, the wire ring",modern_love
Her frantic effort throttling:,modern_love
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!,modern_love
"Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,",modern_love
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.,modern_love
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes,modern_love
And ready to open in brown surprise,modern_love
Should I not answer to his talk,modern_love
Or should he my tears surmise.,modern_love
"I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair",modern_love
Watching the door open: he flashes bare,modern_love
"His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes",modern_love
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise,modern_love
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board,modern_love
"And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword",modern_love
"Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad",modern_love
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud,modern_love
His coming: he raises up my face to him,modern_love
"And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim",modern_love
"Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!",modern_love
"I know not what fine wire is round my throat,",modern_love
I only know I let him finger there,modern_love
"My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat",modern_love
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:,modern_love
"And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down",modern_love
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood,modern_love
"Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood",modern_love
"Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown",modern_love
"Within him, die, and find death good.Supper comes at five o'clock,",modern_love
"At six, the evening star,",modern_love
My lover comes at eight o'clock,modern_love
But eight o'clock is far.,modern_love
How could I bear my pain all day,modern_love
Unless I watched to see,modern_love
The clock-hands laboring to bring,modern_love
"Eight o'clock to me.Go, dumb-born book,",modern_love
Tell her that sang me once that song of Lawes:,modern_love
Hadst thou but song,modern_love
"As thou hast subjects known,",modern_love
Then were there cause in thee that should condone,modern_love
Even my faults that heavy upon me lie,modern_love
And build her glories their longevity.,modern_love
Tell her that sheds,modern_love
"Such treasure in the air,",modern_love
Recking naught else but that her graces give,modern_love
"Life to the moment,",modern_love
I would bid them live,modern_love
"As roses might, in magic amber laid,",modern_love
Red overwrought with orange and all made,modern_love
One substance and one colour,modern_love
Braving time.,modern_love
Tell her that goes,modern_love
With song upon her lips,modern_love
"But sings not out the song, nor knows",modern_love
"The maker of it, some other mouth,",modern_love
"May be as fair as hers,",modern_love
"Might, in new ages, gain her worshippers,",modern_love
"When our two dusts with Wallers shall be laid,",modern_love
"Siftings on siftings in oblivion,",modern_love
Till change hath broken down,modern_love
"All things save Beauty alone.They came to tell your faults to me,",modern_love
They named them over one by one;,modern_love
"I laughed aloud when they were done,",modern_love
"I knew them all so well before, ",modern_love
"Oh, they were blind, too blind to see",modern_love
Your faults had made me love you more.I never knew the earth had so much gold,modern_love
"The fields run over with it, and this hill",modern_love
"Hoary and old,",modern_love
Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.,modern_love
"Such golden fires, such yellowlo, how good",modern_love
"This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",modern_love
"This fringe of wood,",modern_love
Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.,modern_love
"You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",modern_love
"Your face grow mystical, as on that night",modern_love
"You turned to me,",modern_love
And all the trembling worldand youwere white.,modern_love
"Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",modern_love
"The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",modern_love
And you become,modern_love
A goddess standing in a world of fire!When she rises in the morning,modern_love
I linger to watch her;,modern_love
She spreads the bath-cloth underneath the window,modern_love
And the sunbeams catch her,modern_love
"Glistening white on the shoulders,",modern_love
While down her sides the mellow,modern_love
Golden shadow glows as,modern_love
"She stoops to the sponge, and her swung breasts",modern_love
Sway like full-blown yellow,modern_love
Gloire de Dijon roses.,modern_love
"She drips herself with water, and her shoulders",modern_love
"Glisten as silver, they crumple up",modern_love
"Like wet and falling roses, and I listen",modern_love
For the sluicing of their rain-dishevelled petals.,modern_love
In the window full of sunlight,modern_love
Concentrates her golden shadow,modern_love
"Fold on fold, until it glows as",modern_love
Mellow as the glory roses.,modern_love
"Yours is the shame and sorrow,",modern_love
But the disgrace is mine;,modern_love
"Your love was dark and thorough,",modern_love
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower,modern_love
He creates with his shine.,modern_love
"I was diligent to explore you,",modern_love
"Blossom you stalk by stalk,",modern_love
Till my fire of creation bore you,modern_love
Shrivelling down in the final dour,modern_love
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.,modern_love
"I knew your pain, and it broke",modern_love
"My fine, craftsman's nerve;",modern_love
"Your body quailed at my stroke,",modern_love
And my courage failed to give you the last,modern_love
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern_love
"You are shapely, you are adorned,",modern_love
"But opaque and dull in the flesh,",modern_love
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern_love
"Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast",modern_love
In a lovely illumined mesh.,modern_love
Like a painted window: the best,modern_love
"Suffering burnt through your flesh,",modern_love
Undrossed it and left it blest,modern_love
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now,modern_love
Who shall take you afresh?,modern_love
Now who will burn you free,modern_love
"From your body's terrors and dross,",modern_love
Since the fire has failed in me?,modern_love
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern_love
The shrieking cross?,modern_love
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern_love
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern_love
"As I see it hardening,",modern_love
"Warping the perfect image of God,",modern_love
And darkening my eternal fame.,modern_love
Version 2 (1928),modern_love
"Yours is the sullen sorrow,",modern_love
The disgrace is also mine;,modern_love
"Your love was intense and thorough,",modern_love
Mine was the love of a growing flower,modern_love
For the sunshine.,modern_love
"You had the power to explore me,",modern_love
Blossom me stalk by stalk;,modern_love
"You woke my spirit, you bore me",modern_love
"To consciousness, you gave me the dour",modern_love
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.,modern_love
Body to body I could not,modern_love
"Love you, although I would.",modern_love
"We kissed, we kissed though we should not.",modern_love
"You yielded, we threw the last cast,",modern_love
And it was no good.,modern_love
"You only endured, and it broke",modern_love
My craftsman's nerve.,modern_love
No flesh responded to my stroke;,modern_love
So I failed to give you the last,modern_love
Fine torture you did deserve.,modern_love
"You are shapely, you are adorned",modern_love
But opaque and null in the flesh;,modern_love
"Who, had I but pierced with the thorned",modern_love
"Full anguish, perhaps had been cast",modern_love
In a lovely illuinined mesh,modern_love
Like a painted window; the best,modern_love
"Fire passed through your flesh,",modern_love
"Undrossed it, and left it blest",modern_love
In clean new awareness. But now,modern_love
Who shall take you afresh?,modern_love
Now who will burn you free,modern_love
From your body's deadness and dross?,modern_love
"Since the fire has failed in me,",modern_love
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough,modern_love
The shrieking cross?,modern_love
"A mute, nearly beautiful thing",modern_love
"Is your face, that fills me with shame",modern_love
As I see it hardening;,modern_love
I should have been cruel enough to bring,modern_love
"You through the flame.Strephon kissed me in the spring,",modern_love
"Robin in the fall,",modern_love
But Colin only looked at me,modern_love
And never kissed at all.,modern_love
"Strephon's kiss was lost in jest,",modern_love
"Robin's lost in play,",modern_love
But the kiss in Colin's eyes,modern_love
"Haunts me night and day.Let us go then, you and I,",modern_love
When the evening is spread out against the sky,modern_love
Like a patient etherized upon a table;,modern_love
"Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,",modern_love
The muttering retreats,modern_love
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels,modern_love
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:,modern_love
Streets that follow like a tedious argument,modern_love
Of insidious intent,modern_love
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...,modern_love
"Oh, do not ask, What is it?",modern_love
Let us go and make our visit.,modern_love
In the room the women come and go,modern_love
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern_love
"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,",modern_love
"The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,",modern_love
"Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,",modern_love
"Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,",modern_love
"Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,",modern_love
"Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,",modern_love
"And seeing that it was a soft October night,",modern_love
"Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.",modern_love
And indeed there will be time,modern_love
"For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,",modern_love
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;,modern_love
"There will be time, there will be time",modern_love
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;,modern_love
"There will be time to murder and create,",modern_love
And time for all the works and days of hands,modern_love
That lift and drop a question on your plate;,modern_love
"Time for you and time for me,",modern_love
"And time yet for a hundred indecisions,",modern_love
"And for a hundred visions and revisions,",modern_love
Before the taking of a toast and tea.,modern_love
In the room the women come and go,modern_love
Talking of Michelangelo.,modern_love
And indeed there will be time,modern_love
"To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?",modern_love
"Time to turn back and descend the stair,",modern_love
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair ,modern_love
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!),modern_love
"My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,",modern_love
"My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin ",modern_love
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!),modern_love
Do I dare,modern_love
Disturb the universe?,modern_love
In a minute there is time,modern_love
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.,modern_love
"For I have known them all already, known them all:",modern_love
"Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,",modern_love
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;,modern_love
I know the voices dying with a dying fall,modern_love
Beneath the music from a farther room.,modern_love
So how should I presume?,modern_love
"And I have known the eyes already, known them all",modern_love
"The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,",modern_love
"And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,",modern_love
"When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,",modern_love
Then how should I begin,modern_love
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?,modern_love
And how should I presume?,modern_love
"And I have known the arms already, known them all",modern_love
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare,modern_love
"(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)",modern_love
Is it perfume from a dress,modern_love
That makes me so digress?,modern_love
"Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.",modern_love
And should I then presume?,modern_love
And how should I begin?,modern_love
"Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets",modern_love
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes,modern_love
"Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...",modern_love
I should have been a pair of ragged claws,modern_love
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.,modern_love
"And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!",modern_love
"Smoothed by long fingers,",modern_love
"Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,",modern_love
"Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.",modern_love
"Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,",modern_love
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?,modern_love
"But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,",modern_love
"Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,",modern_love
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;,modern_love
"I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,",modern_love
"And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,",modern_love
"And in short, I was afraid.",modern_love
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern_love
"After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,",modern_love
"Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,",modern_love
"Would it have been worth while,",modern_love
"To have bitten off the matter with a smile,",modern_love
To have squeezed the universe into a ball,modern_love
"To roll it towards some overwhelming question,",modern_love
"To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,",modern_love
"Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all",modern_love
"If one, settling a pillow by her head",modern_love
Should say: That is not what I meant at all;,modern_love
"That is not it, at all.",modern_love
"And would it have been worth it, after all,",modern_love
"Would it have been worth while,",modern_love
"After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,",modern_love
"After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor",modern_love
"And this, and so much more?",modern_love
It is impossible to say just what I mean!,modern_love
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:,modern_love
Would it have been worth while,modern_love
"If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,",modern_love
"And turning toward the window, should say:",modern_love
"That is not it at all,",modern_love
"That is not what I meant, at all.",modern_love
"No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;",modern_love
"Am an attendant lord, one that will do",modern_love
"To swell a progress, start a scene or two,",modern_love
"Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,",modern_love
"Deferential, glad to be of use,",modern_love
"Politic, cautious, and meticulous;",modern_love
"Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;",modern_love
"At times, indeed, almost ridiculous",modern_love
"Almost, at times, the Fool.",modern_love
I grow old ... I grow old ...,modern_love
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.,modern_love
Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?,modern_love
"I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.",modern_love
"I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.",modern_love
I do not think that they will sing to me.,modern_love
I have seen them riding seaward on the waves,modern_love
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back,modern_love
When the wind blows the water white and black.,modern_love
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea,modern_love
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown,modern_love
"Till human voices wake us, and we drown.I went to the dances at Chandlerville,",modern_love
And played snap-out at Winchester.,modern_love
"One time we changed partners,",modern_love
"Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,",modern_love
And then I found Davis.,modern_love
"We were married and lived together for seventy years,",modern_love
"Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,",modern_love
Eight of whom we lost,modern_love
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.,modern_love
"I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,",modern_love
"I made the garden, and for holiday",modern_love
"Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,",modern_love
"And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,",modern_love
And many a flower and medicinal weed ,modern_love
"Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.",modern_love
"At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,",modern_love
And passed to a sweet repose.,modern_love
"What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,",modern_love
"Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?",modern_love
"Degenerate sons and daughters,",modern_love
Life is too strong for you ,modern_love
"It takes life to love Life.Seen my lady home las' night,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Hel' huh han' an' sque'z it tight,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Hyeahd huh sigh a little sigh,",modern_love
"Seen a light gleam f'om huh eye,",modern_love
An' a smile go flittin' by ,modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Hyeahd de win' blow thoo de pine,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"Mockin'-bird was singin' fine,",modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love
"An' my hea't was beatin' so,",modern_love
"When I reached my lady's do',",modern_love
Dat I could n't ba' to go ,modern_love
"Jump back, honey, jump back.",modern_love

"It gwine keep on saggin' low.I saw her in a Broadway car,",modern_love
The woman I might grow to be;,modern_love
I felt my lover look at her,modern_love
And then turn suddenly to me.,modern_love
Her hair was dull and drew no light,modern_love
And yet its color was as mine;,modern_love
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes,modern_love
Tho' love had never made them shine.,modern_love
"Her body was a thing grown thin,",modern_love
Hungry for love that never came;,modern_love
Her soul was frozen in the dark,modern_love
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.,modern_love
I felt my lover look at her,modern_love
"And then turn suddenly to me, ",modern_love
His eyes were magic to defy,modern_love
The woman I shall never be.,modern_love
Just as my fingers on these keys,modern_love
"Make music, so the selfsame sounds",modern_love
"On my spirit make a music, too.",modern_love
"Music is feeling, then, not sound;",modern_love
"And thus it is that what I feel,",modern_love
"Here in this room, desiring you,",modern_love
"Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,",modern_love
Is music. It is like the strain,modern_love
Waked in the elders by Susanna: ,modern_love
"Of a green evening, clear and warm,",modern_love
"She bathed in her still garden, while",modern_love
"The red-eyed elders, watching, felt",modern_love
The basses of their beings throb,modern_love
"In witching chords, and their thin blood",modern_love
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.,modern_love
"In the green water, clear and warm,",modern_love
Susanna lay.,modern_love
She searched,modern_love
"The touch of springs,",modern_love
And found,modern_love
Concealed imaginings.,modern_love
"She sighed,",modern_love
For so much melody.,modern_love
"Upon the bank, she stood",modern_love
In the cool,modern_love
Of spent emotions.,modern_love
"She felt, among the leaves,",modern_love
The dew,modern_love
Of old devotions.,modern_love
"She walked upon the grass,",modern_love
Still quavering.,modern_love
"The winds were like her maids,",modern_love
"On timid feet,",modern_love
"Fetching her woven scarves,",modern_love
Yet wavering.,modern_love
A breath upon her hand,modern_love
Muted the night.,modern_love
She turned,modern_love
"A cymbal crashed,",modern_love
And roaring horns.,modern_love
"Soon, with a noise like tambourines,",modern_love
Came her attendant Byzantines.,modern_love
They wondered why Susanna cried,modern_love
Against the elders by her side;,modern_love
"And as they whispered, the refrain",modern_love
Was like a willow swept by rain.,modern_love
"Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame",modern_love
Revealed Susanna and her shame.,modern_love
"And then, the simpering Byzantines",modern_love
"Fled, with a noise like tambourines.",modern_love
Beauty is momentary in the mind,modern_love
The fitful tracing of a portal;,modern_love
But in the flesh it is immortal.,modern_love
The body dies; the body's beauty lives.,modern_love
"So evenings die, in their green going,",modern_love
"A wave, interminably flowing.",modern_love
"So gardens die, their meek breath scenting",modern_love
"The cowl of winter, done repenting.",modern_love
"So maidens die, to the auroral",modern_love
Celebration of a maiden's choral.,modern_love
Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings,modern_love
"Of those white elders; but, escaping,",modern_love
Left only Death's ironic scraping.,modern_love
"Now, in its immortality, it plays",modern_love
"On the clear viol of her memory,",modern_love
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.I,modern_love
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon,modern_love
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do,modern_love
"With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";",modern_love
"And four wax candles in the darkened room,",modern_love
"Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,",modern_love
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb,modern_love
"Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.",modern_love
"We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole",modern_love
"Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.",modern_love
"So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.",modern_love
And so the conversation slips,modern_love
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets,modern_love
Through attenuated tones of violins,modern_love
Mingled with remote cornets,modern_love
And begins.,modern_love
"You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,",modern_love
"And how, how rare and strange it is, to find",modern_love
"In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,",modern_love
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!,modern_love
How keen you are!),modern_love
"To find a friend who has these qualities,",modern_love
"Who has, and gives",modern_love
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.,modern_love
How much it means that I say this to you ,modern_love
"Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!",modern_love
Among the winding of the violins,modern_love
And the ariettes,modern_love
Of cracked cornets,modern_love
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins,modern_love
"Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,",modern_love
Capricious monotone,modern_love
"That is at least one definite ""false note.""",modern_love
" Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,",modern_love
"Admire the monuments,",modern_love
"Discuss the late events,",modern_love
Correct our watches by the public clocks.,modern_love
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.,modern_love
Now that lilacs are in bloom,modern_love
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room,modern_love
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.,modern_love
"Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands;",modern_love
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks),modern_love
"You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.",modern_love
"I smile, of course,",modern_love
And go on drinking tea.,modern_love
"Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall",modern_love
"My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,",modern_love
"I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world",modern_love
"To be wonderful and youthful, after all.",modern_love
The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune,modern_love
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:,modern_love
I am always sure that you understand,modern_love
"My feelings, always sure that you feel,",modern_love
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.,modern_love
"You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.",modern_love
"You will go on, and when you have prevailed",modern_love
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.,modern_love
"But what have I, but what have I, my friend,",modern_love
"To give you, what can you receive from me?",modern_love
Only the friendship and the sympathy,modern_love
Of one about to reach her journey's end.,modern_love
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....",modern_love
I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends,modern_love
For what she has said to me?,modern_love
You will see me any morning in the park,modern_love
Reading the comics and the sporting page.,modern_love
Particularly I remark.,modern_love
An English countess goes upon the stage.,modern_love
"A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,",modern_love
Another bank defaulter has confessed.,modern_love
"I keep my countenance,",modern_love
I remain self-possessed,modern_love
"Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired",modern_love
Reiterates some worn-out common song,modern_love
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden,modern_love
Recalling things that other people have desired.,modern_love
Are these ideas right or wrong?,modern_love
The October night comes down; returning as before,modern_love
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease,modern_love
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door,modern_love
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.,modern_love
And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?,modern_love
But that's a useless question.,modern_love
"You hardly know when you are coming back,",modern_love
You will find so much to learn.,modern_love
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.,modern_love
Perhaps you can write to me.,modern_love
My self-possession flares up for a second;,modern_love
This is as I had reckoned.,modern_love
"I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.",modern_love
"I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark",modern_love
"Suddenly, his expression in a glass.",modern_love
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.,modern_love
"For everybody said so, all our friends,",modern_love
They all were sure our feelings would relate,modern_love
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.,modern_love
We must leave it now to fate.,modern_love
"You will write, at any rate.",modern_love
Perhaps it is not too late.,modern_love
"I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.",modern_love
And I must borrow every changing shape,modern_love
"To find expression ... dance, dance",modern_love
"Like a dancing bear,",modern_love
"Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.",modern_love
"Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance",modern_love
"Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,",modern_love
"Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;",modern_love
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand,modern_love
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;,modern_love
"Doubtful, for quite a while",modern_love
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand,modern_love
"Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...",modern_love
"Would she not have the advantage, after all?",modern_love
"This music is successful with a ""dying fall""",modern_love
Now that we talk of dying,modern_love
"And should I have the right to smile?Maurice, weep not, I am not here under this pine tree.",modern_love
"The balmy air of spring whispers through the sweet grass,",modern_love
"The stars sparkle, the whippoorwill calls,",modern_love
"But thou grievest, while my soul lies rapturous",modern_love
In the blest Nirvana of eternal light!,modern_love
"Go to the good heart that is my husband,",modern_love
Who broods upon what he calls our guilty love: i,modern_love
"Tell him that my love for you, no less than my love for him",modern_love
Wrought out my destiny i that through the flesh,modern_love
"I won spirit, and through spirit, peace.",modern_love
"There is no marriage in heaven,",modern_love
But there is love.I shall not go with pain,modern_love
"Whether you hold me, whether you forget",modern_love
My little loss and my immortal gain.,modern_love
"O flower unseen, O fountain sealed apart!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look remembering yet,",modern_love
Sweet heart.,modern_love
"I shall not go with grief,",modern_love
"Whether you call me, whether you deny",modern_love
The crowning vintage and the golden sheaf.,modern_love
"O, April hopes that blossom but to close!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look and so good-bye,",modern_love
Red rose.,modern_love
"I shall not go with sighs,",modern_love
"But as full-crowned the warrior leaves the fight,",modern_love
Dawn on his shield and death upon his eyes.,modern_love
"O, life so bitter-sweet and heaven so far!",modern_love
"Give me one look, one look and so good night,",modern_love
"My star.Wintah, summah, snow er shine,",modern_love
"Hit's all de same to me,",modern_love
"Ef only I kin call you mine,",modern_love
An' keep you by my knee.,modern_love
"Ha'dship, frolic, grief er caih,",modern_love

Ef only I kin see you whaih,modern_love
You wait beside de way.,modern_love
"Livin', dyin', smiles er teahs,",modern_love
"My soul will still be free,",modern_love
Ef only thoo de comin' yeahs,modern_love

"What puny t'ings dey'll be,",modern_love
"Ef w'en I's seemin' all erlone,",modern_love
I knows yo' hea't's wid me.This youth too long has heard the break,modern_love
Of waters in a land of change.,modern_love
He goes to see what suns can make,modern_love
From soil more indurate and strange.,modern_love
He cuts what holds his days together,modern_love
"And shuts him in, as lock on lock:",modern_love
"The arrowed vane announcing weather,",modern_love
The tripping racket of a clock;,modern_love
"Seeking, I think, a light that waits",modern_love
"Still as a lamp upon a shelf, ",modern_love
A land with hills like rocky gates,modern_love
Where no sea leaps upon itself.,modern_love
But he will find that nothing dares,modern_love
"To be enduring, save where, south",modern_love
"Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares",modern_love
"On beauty with a rusted mouth, ",modern_love
Where something dreadful and another,modern_love
Look quietly upon each other.Making his advances,modern_love
"He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,",modern_love
"No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.",modern_love
Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin,modern_love
That work beneath her while she sprawls along,modern_love
"In her ungainly pace,",modern_love
Her folds of skin that work and row,modern_love
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.,modern_love
And so he strains beneath her housey walls,modern_love
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak,modern_love
"Suddenly, or her skinny limb,",modern_love
And strange and grimly drags at her,modern_love
"Like a dog,",modern_love
"Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.",modern_love
"Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.",modern_love
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation,modern_love
"And doomed to partiality, partial being,",modern_love
"Ache, and want of being,",modern_love
"Want,",modern_love
"Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.",modern_love
"Born to walk alone,",modern_love
"Forerunner,",modern_love
"Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,",modern_love
"This awkward, harrowing pursuit,",modern_love
This grim necessity from within.,modern_love
Does she know,modern_love
As she moves eternally slowly away?,modern_love
"Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,",modern_love
All knowledgeless?,modern_love
"The awful concussion,",modern_love
"And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,",modern_love
"Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,",modern_love
"At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,",modern_love
"Driven away from himself into her tracks,",modern_love
Forced to crash against her.,modern_love
"Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,",modern_love
"Little gentleman,",modern_love
"Sorry plight,",modern_love
We ought to look the other way.,modern_love
"Save that, having come with you so far,",modern_love
"We will go on to the end.I thought he was dumb,",modern_love
"I said he was dumb,",modern_love
Yet I've heard him cry.,modern_love
"First faint scream,",modern_love
"Out of life's unfathomable dawn,",modern_love
"Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,",modern_love
"Far, far off, far scream.",modern_love
Tortoise in extremis.,modern_love
Why were we crucified into sex?,modern_love
"Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,",modern_love
"As we began,",modern_love
"As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?",modern_love
"A far, was-it-audible scream,",modern_love
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?,modern_love
"Worse than the cry of the new-born,",modern_love
"A scream,",modern_love
"A yell,",modern_love
"A shout,",modern_love
"A pan,",modern_love
"A death-agony,",modern_love
"A birth-cry,",modern_love
"A submission,",modern_love
"All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.",modern_love
"War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,",modern_love
Why was the veil torn?,modern_love
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?,modern_love
The male soul's membrane,modern_love
"Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.",modern_love
Crucifixion.,modern_love
"Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,",modern_love
"Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell",modern_love
"In tortoise-nakedness,",modern_love
"Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,",modern_love
"And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,",modern_love
"Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension",modern_love
"Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!",modern_love
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck,modern_love
"And giving that fragile yell, that scream,",modern_love
"Super-audible,",modern_love
"From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,",modern_love
"Giving up the ghost,",modern_love
"Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.",modern_love
"His scream, and his moment's subsidence,",modern_love
"The moment of eternal silence,",modern_love
"Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once",modern_love
The inexpressible faint yell ,modern_love
"And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back",modern_love
"To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.",modern_love
"So he tups, and screams",modern_love
"Time after time that frail, torn scream",modern_love
"After each jerk, the longish interval,",modern_love
"The tortoise eternity,",modern_love
"Agelong, reptilian persistence,",modern_love
"Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.",modern_love
"I remember, when I was a boy,",modern_love
"I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;",modern_love
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;,modern_love
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night,modern_love
"Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;",modern_love
"I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;",modern_love
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;,modern_love
"I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;",modern_love
"I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;",modern_love
"I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning",modern_love
"And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,",modern_love
"And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,",modern_love
"The first wail of an infant,",modern_love
"And my mother singing to herself,",modern_love
"And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,",modern_love
The first elements of foreign speech,modern_love
On wild dark lips.,modern_love
"And more than all these,",modern_love
"And less than all these,",modern_love
"This last,",modern_love
"Strange, faint coition yell",modern_love
"Of the male tortoise at extremity,",modern_love
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.,modern_love
"The cross,",modern_love
"The wheel on which our silence first is broken,",modern_love
"Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence",modern_love
Tearing a cry from us.,modern_love
"Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,",modern_love
"Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.",modern_love
"Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,",modern_love
"The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,",modern_love
"That which is whole, torn asunder,",modern_love
"That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe. With the man I love who loves me not,",modern_love
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;,modern_love
We watched the world go home that night,modern_love
In a flood through Union Square.,modern_love
I leaned to catch the words he said,modern_love
That were light as a snowflake falling;,modern_love
Ah well that he never leaned to hear,modern_love
The words my heart was calling.,modern_love
And on we walked and on we walked,modern_love
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows ,modern_love
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by,modern_love
On the errand each man knows.,modern_love
"And on we walked and on we walked,",modern_love
At the door at last we said good-bye;,modern_love
I knew by his smile he had not heard,modern_love
My heart's unuttered cry.,modern_love
With the man I love who loves me not,modern_love
I walked in the street-lamps' flare ,modern_love
"But oh, the girls who ask for love",modern_love
In the lights of Union Square.,modern_love
"When you are old and grey and full of sleep,",modern_love
"And nodding by the fire, take down this book,",modern_love
"And slowly read, and dream of the soft look",modern_love
"Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;",modern_love
"How many loved your moments of glad grace,",modern_love
"And loved your beauty with love false or true,",modern_love
"But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,",modern_love
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;,modern_love
"And bending down beside the glowing bars,",modern_love
"Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled",modern_love
And paced upon the mountains overhead,modern_love
"And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.Give me hunger,",modern_love
O you gods that sit and give,modern_love
The world its orders.,modern_love
"Give me hunger, pain and want,",modern_love
Shut me out with shame and failure,modern_love
"From your doors of gold and fame,",modern_love
"Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!",modern_love
"But leave me a little love,",modern_love
"A voice to speak to me in the day end,",modern_love
A hand to touch me in the dark room,modern_love
Breaking the long loneliness.,modern_love
In the dusk of day-shapes,modern_love
"Blurring the sunset,",modern_love
"One little wandering, western star",modern_love
Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.,modern_love
"Let me go to the window,",modern_love
Watch there the day-shapes of dusk,modern_love
And wait and know the coming,modern_love
"Of a little love.Potuia, potuia",modern_love
"White grave goddess,",modern_love
"Pity my sadness,",modern_love
O silence of Paros.,modern_love
"I am not of these about thy feet,",modern_love
These garments and decorum;,modern_love
"I am thy brother,",modern_love
"Thy lover of aforetime crying to thee,",modern_love
And thou hearest me not.,modern_love
I have whispered thee in thy solitudes,modern_love
"Of our loves in Phrygia,",modern_love
The far ecstasy of burning noons,modern_love
When the fragile pipes,modern_love
"Ceased in the cypress shade,",modern_love
And the brown fingers of the shepherd,modern_love
Moved over slim shoulders;,modern_love
And only the cicada sang.,modern_love
I have told thee of the hills,modern_love
And the lisp of reeds,modern_love
"And the sun upon thy breasts,",modern_love
"And thou hearest me not,",modern_love
"Potuia, potuia",modern_love
Thou hearest me not.,modern_love
