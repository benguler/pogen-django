"Angels affect us oft, and worshipp'd be;",renaissance_nature
"         Still when, to where thou wert, I came,",renaissance_nature
Some lovely glorious nothing I did see.,renaissance_nature
"         But since my soul, whose child love is,",renaissance_nature
"Takes limbs of flesh, and else could nothing do,",renaissance_nature
         More subtle than the parent is,renaissance_nature
"Love must not be, but take a body too;",renaissance_nature
"         And therefore what thou wert, and who,",renaissance_nature
"                I bid Love ask, and now",renaissance_nature
"That it assume thy body, I allow,",renaissance_nature
"And fix itself in thy lip, eye, and brow.",renaissance_nature
"Whilst thus to ballast love I thought,",renaissance_nature
"And so more steadily to have gone,",renaissance_nature

"The violet's reclining head,",renaissance_nature
"         Sat we two, one another's best.",renaissance_nature
Our hands were firmly cemented,renaissance_nature
"         With a fast balm, which thence did spring;",renaissance_nature

         Our eyes upon one double string;,renaissance_nature
"So to'intergraft our hands, as yet",renaissance_nature
"         Was all the means to make us one,",renaissance_nature

         Was all our propagation.,renaissance_nature
As 'twixt two equal armies fate,renaissance_nature
"         Suspends uncertain victory,",renaissance_nature
Our souls (which to advance their state,renaissance_nature
         Were gone out) hung 'twixt her and me.,renaissance_nature
"And whilst our souls negotiate there,",renaissance_nature
         We like sepulchral statues lay;,renaissance_nature
"All day, the same our postures were,",renaissance_nature
"         And we said nothing, all the day.",renaissance_nature
"If any, so by love refin'd",renaissance_nature
"         That he soul's language understood,",renaissance_nature

"         Within convenient distance stood,",renaissance_nature
"He (though he knew not which soul spake,",renaissance_nature

Might thence a new concoction take,renaissance_nature

"This ecstasy doth unperplex,",renaissance_nature
"         We said, and tell us what we love;",renaissance_nature
"We see by this it was not sex,",renaissance_nature
         We see we saw not what did move;,renaissance_nature
But as all several souls contain,renaissance_nature
"         Mixture of things, they know not what,",renaissance_nature
Love these mix'd souls doth mix again,renaissance_nature
"         And makes both one, each this and that.",renaissance_nature
"A single violet transplant,",renaissance_nature
"         The strength, the colour, and the size,",renaissance_nature
(All which before was poor and scant),renaissance_nature
"         Redoubles still, and multiplies.",renaissance_nature
When love with one another so,renaissance_nature
"         Interinanimates two souls,",renaissance_nature
"That abler soul, which thence doth flow,",renaissance_nature
         Defects of loneliness controls.,renaissance_nature
"We then, who are this new soul, know",renaissance_nature
"         Of what we are compos'd and made,",renaissance_nature
For th' atomies of which we grow,renaissance_nature
"         Are souls, whom no change can invade.",renaissance_nature
"But oh alas, so long, so far,",renaissance_nature
         Our bodies why do we forbear?,renaissance_nature
"They'are ours, though they'are not we; we are",renaissance_nature
"         The intelligences, they the spheres.",renaissance_nature
"We owe them thanks, because they thus",renaissance_nature
"         Did us, to us, at first convey,",renaissance_nature
"Yielded their senses' force to us,",renaissance_nature
"         Nor are dross to us, but allay.",renaissance_nature
"On man heaven's influence works not so,",renaissance_nature
         But that it first imprints the air;,renaissance_nature
"So soul into the soul may flow,",renaissance_nature
            Though it to body first repair.,renaissance_nature
As our blood labors to beget,renaissance_nature
"         Spirits, as like souls as it can,",renaissance_nature
Because such fingers need to knit,renaissance_nature
"         That subtle knot which makes us man,",renaissance_nature
So must pure lovers' souls descend,renaissance_nature
"         T' affections, and to faculties,",renaissance_nature
"Which sense may reach and apprehend,",renaissance_nature
         Else a great prince in prison lies.,renaissance_nature
"To'our bodies turn we then, that so",renaissance_nature
         Weak men on love reveal'd may look;,renaissance_nature
"Love's mysteries in souls do grow,",renaissance_nature
         But yet the body is his book.,renaissance_nature
"And if some lover, such as we,",renaissance_nature
"         Have heard this dialogue of one,",renaissance_nature
"Let him still mark us, he shall see",renaissance_nature
"         Small change, when we'are to bodies gone.No spring nor summer beauty hath such grace",renaissance_nature
         As I have seen in one autumnal face.,renaissance_nature
"Young beauties force our love, and that's a rape,",renaissance_nature
"         This doth but counsel, yet you cannot scape.",renaissance_nature
"If 'twere a shame to love, here 'twere no shame;",renaissance_nature
         Affection here takes reverence's name.,renaissance_nature
"Were her first years the golden age? That's true,",renaissance_nature
         But now she's gold oft tried and ever new.,renaissance_nature
"That was her torrid and inflaming time,",renaissance_nature
         This is her tolerable tropic clime.,renaissance_nature
"Fair eyes, who asks more heat than comes from hence,",renaissance_nature
         He in a fever wishes pestilence.,renaissance_nature
"Call not these wrinkles, graves; if graves they were,",renaissance_nature
"         They were Love's graves, for else he is no where.",renaissance_nature
"Yet lies not Love dead here, but here doth sit",renaissance_nature
"         Vow'd to this trench, like an anachorit;",renaissance_nature
"And here till hers, which must be his death, come,",renaissance_nature
"         He doth not dig a grave, but build a tomb.",renaissance_nature
Here dwells he; though he sojourn ev'rywhere,renaissance_nature
"         In progress, yet his standing house is here:",renaissance_nature
"Here where still evening is, not noon nor night,",renaissance_nature
"         Where no voluptuousness, yet all delight.",renaissance_nature
"In all her words, unto all hearers fit,",renaissance_nature
"         You may at revels, you at council, sit.",renaissance_nature
"This is Love's timber, youth his underwood;",renaissance_nature
"         There he, as wine in June, enrages blood,",renaissance_nature
Which then comes seasonabliest when our taste,renaissance_nature
         And appetite to other things is past.,renaissance_nature
"Xerxes' strange Lydian love, the platan tree,",renaissance_nature
"         Was lov'd for age, none being so large as she,",renaissance_nature
"Or else because, being young, nature did bless",renaissance_nature
"         Her youth with age's glory, barrenness.",renaissance_nature
"If we love things long sought, age is a thing",renaissance_nature
         Which we are fifty years in compassing;,renaissance_nature
"If transitory things, which soon decay,",renaissance_nature
         Age must be loveliest at the latest day.,renaissance_nature
"But name not winter faces, whose skin's slack,",renaissance_nature
"         Lank as an unthrift's purse, but a soul's sack;",renaissance_nature
"Whose eyes seek light within, for all here's shade;",renaissance_nature
"         Whose mouths are holes, rather worn out than made;",renaissance_nature
"Whose every tooth to a several place is gone,",renaissance_nature
         To vex their souls at resurrection:,renaissance_nature
"Name not these living death's-heads unto me,",renaissance_nature
"         For these, not ancient, but antique be.",renaissance_nature
"I hate extremes, yet I had rather stay",renaissance_nature
"         With tombs than cradles, to wear out a day.",renaissance_nature
"Since such love's natural lation is, may still",renaissance_nature
"         My love descend, and journey down the hill,",renaissance_nature
"Not panting after growing beauties. So,",renaissance_nature
         I shall ebb on with them who homeward go.Here take my picture; though I bid farewell,renaissance_nature
"Thine, in my heart, where my soul dwells, shall dwell.",renaissance_nature
"'Tis like me now, but I dead, 'twill be more",renaissance_nature
"When we are shadows both, than 'twas before.",renaissance_nature
"When weather-beaten I come back, my hand",renaissance_nature
"Perhaps with rude oars torn, or sun beams tann'd,",renaissance_nature
"My face and breast of haircloth, and my head",renaissance_nature
"With care's rash sudden storms being o'erspread,",renaissance_nature
"My body'a sack of bones, broken within,",renaissance_nature
And powder's blue stains scatter'd on my skin;,renaissance_nature
If rival fools tax thee to'have lov'd a man,renaissance_nature
"So foul and coarse as, oh, I may seem then,",renaissance_nature
"This shall say what I was, and thou shalt say,",renaissance_nature
"Do his hurts reach me? doth my worth decay?
Or do they reach his judging mind, that he
Should now love less, what he did love to see?
That which in him was fair and delicate,
Was but the milk which in love's childish state
Did nurse it; who now is grown strong enough
To feed on that, which to disus'd tastes seems tough.Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?",renaissance_nature
"Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste,",renaissance_nature
"I run to death, and death meets me as fast,",renaissance_nature
And all my pleasures are like yesterday;,renaissance_nature
"I dare not move my dim eyes any way,",renaissance_nature
"Despair behind, and death before doth cast",renaissance_nature
"Such terror, and my feebled flesh doth waste",renaissance_nature
"By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.",renaissance_nature
"Only thou art above, and when towards thee",renaissance_nature
"By thy leave I can look, I rise again;",renaissance_nature
"But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,",renaissance_nature
That not one hour I can myself sustain;,renaissance_nature
"Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,",renaissance_nature
"And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.Since I am coming to that holy room,",renaissance_nature
"         Where, with thy choir of saints for evermore,",renaissance_nature
I shall be made thy music; as I come,renaissance_nature
"         I tune the instrument here at the door,",renaissance_nature
"         And what I must do then, think here before.",renaissance_nature
Whilst my physicians by their love are grown,renaissance_nature
"         Cosmographers, and I their map, who lie",renaissance_nature
"Flat on this bed, that by them may be shown",renaissance_nature
"         That this is my south-west discovery,",renaissance_nature

         So death doth touch the resurrection.,renaissance_nature
Is the Pacific Sea my home? Or are,renaissance_nature
         The eastern riches? Is Jerusalem?,renaissance_nature
"Anyan, and Magellan, and Gibraltar,",renaissance_nature
"         All straits, and none but straits, are ways to them,",renaissance_nature
"         Whether where Japhet dwelt, or Cham, or Shem.",renaissance_nature
"We think that Paradise and Calvary,",renaissance_nature
"         Christ's cross, and Adam's tree, stood in one place;",renaissance_nature
"Look, Lord, and find both Adams met in me;",renaissance_nature

         May the last Adam's blood my soul embrace.,renaissance_nature
"So, in his purple wrapp'd, receive me, Lord;",renaissance_nature

An endless wind doth tear the sail apace,renaissance_nature
Of forced sighs and trusty fearfulness.,renaissance_nature

Hath done the weared cords great hinderance;,renaissance_nature
Wreathed with error and eke with ignorance.,renaissance_nature

Would needs go seek her townish sister's house.,renaissance_nature
She thought herself endured too much pain;,renaissance_nature
The stormy blasts her cave so sore did souse,renaissance_nature
"That when the furrows swimmed with the rain,",renaissance_nature
She must lie cold and wet in sorry plight;,renaissance_nature
"And worse than that, bare meat there did remain",renaissance_nature
To comfort her when she her house had dight;,renaissance_nature
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;,renaissance_nature
For which she laboured hard both day and night,renaissance_nature
In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;,renaissance_nature
"And where store was stroyed with the flood,",renaissance_nature
Then well away! for she undone was clean.,renaissance_nature
Then was she fain to take instead of food,renaissance_nature
"Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.",renaissance_nature
"My sister, quod she,"" """"hath a living good"",",renaissance_nature

In a round head with sharp ears. In France,renaissance_nature
"Was never mouse so fear'd, for the unwise",renaissance_nature
"Had not i-seen such a beast before,",renaissance_nature
Yet had nature taught her after her guise,renaissance_nature
To know her foe and dread him evermore.,renaissance_nature

Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance_nature
For sure they did not seem,renaissance_nature
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance_nature
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance_nature
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance_nature
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance_nature
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance_nature
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance_nature
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_nature
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_nature
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance_nature
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance_nature
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance_nature
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance_nature

"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance_nature
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance_nature
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance_nature

Their accents did resound.,renaissance_nature

"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",renaissance_nature
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",renaissance_nature
Making his stream run slow.,renaissance_nature
