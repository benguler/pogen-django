"By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred,renaissance_mythology_folklore

Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"From turning backe, and forced her to stay:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

With doubled forces high above the ground:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine",renaissance_mythology_folklore

That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
As when old father Nilus gins to swell,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"All striving to infixe their feeble stings,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That from their noyance he no where can rest,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
But with his clownish hands their tender wings,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"And strooke at her with more then manly force,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That from her body full of filthie sin,renaissance_mythology_folklore
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They saw so rudely falling to the ground,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Gathred themselves about her body round,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Weening their wonted entrance to have found,renaissance_mythology_folklore
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They flocked all about her bleeding wound,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And sucked up their dying mothers blood,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That detestable sight him much amazde,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

And with the Lady backward sought to wend;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Ne ever would to any by-way bend,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But still did follow one unto the end,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
The which at last out of the wood them brought.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
So forward on his way (with God to frend),renaissance_mythology_folklore

Where she could sit for men to gaze upon.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The outside of her garments were of lawn,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her wide sleeves green, and border'd with a grove,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where Venus in her naked glory strove,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To please the careless and disdainful eyes,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of proud Adonis, that before her lies;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Made with the blood of wretched lovers slain.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
From whence her veil reach'd to the ground beneath;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Her veil was artificial flowers and leaves,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Whose workmanship both man and beast deceives;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
When 'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And there for honey bees have sought in vain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And beat from thence, have lighted there again.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"About her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Which lighten'd by her neck, like diamonds shone.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
She ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Would burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Or warm or cool them, for they took delight",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To play upon those hands, they were so white.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Buskins of shells, all silver'd, used she,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And branch'd with blushing coral to the knee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where sparrows perch'd, of hollow pearl and gold,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such as the world would wonder to behold:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Which as she went, would chirrup through the bills.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Some say, for her the fairest Cupid pin'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And looking in her face, was strooken blind.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But this is true; so like was one the other,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As he imagin'd Hero was his mother;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And oftentimes into her bosom flew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"About her naked neck his bare arms threw,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And laid his childish head upon her breast,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with still panting rock'd there took his rest.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So lovely-fair was Hero, Venus' nun,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As Nature wept, thinking she was undone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Because she took more from her than she left,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And of such wondrous beauty her bereft:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Therefore, in sign her treasure suffer'd wrack,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Since Hero's time hath half the world been black.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Dwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none,renaissance_mythology_folklore
For whom succeeding times make greater moan.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His dangling tresses, that were never shorn,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Had they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of Greece,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To hazard more than for the golden fleece.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Fair Cynthia wish'd his arms might be her sphere;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Grief makes her pale, because she moves not there.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
His body was as straight as Circe's wand;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Jove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as delicious meat is to the taste,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So was his neck in touching, and surpast",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The white of Pelops' shoulder: I could tell ye,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"How smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And whose immortal fingers did imprint,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That heavenly path with many a curious dint,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That runs along his back; but my rude pen,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Can hardly blazon forth the loves of men,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Much less of powerful gods: let it suffice,renaissance_mythology_folklore
That my slack Muse sings of Leander's eyes;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Those orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That leapt into the water for a kiss,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of his own shadow, and, despising many,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Had wild Hippolytus Leander seen,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Enamour'd of his beauty had he been.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"His presence made the rudest peasant melt,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That in the vast uplandish country dwelt;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The barbarous Thracian soldier, mov'd with nought,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was mov'd with him, and for his favour sought.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Some swore he was a maid in man's attire,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For in his looks were all that men desire,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
A brow for love to banquet royally;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And such as knew he was a man, would say,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Why art thou not in love, and lov'd of all?",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Though thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For his sake whom their goddess held so dear,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Rose-cheek'd Adonis, kept a solemn feast.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thither resorted many a wandering guest,renaissance_mythology_folklore
To meet their loves; such as had none at all,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Came lovers home from this great festival;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For every street, like to a firmament,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Glister'd with breathing stars, who, where they went,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Frighted the melancholy earth, which deem'd",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Eternal heaven to burn, for so it seem'd",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As if another Pha{""e}ton had got",renaissance_mythology_folklore
The guidance of the sun's rich chariot.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And stole away th' enchanted gazer's mind;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For like sea-nymphs' inveigling harmony,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So was her beauty to the standers-by;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Nor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star",renaissance_mythology_folklore
(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"From Latmus' mount up to the gloomy sky,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where, crown'd with blazing light and majesty,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Than she the hearts of those that near her stood.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Wretched Ixion's shaggy-footed race,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Incens'd with savage heat, gallop amain",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"From steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So ran the people forth to gaze upon her,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And all that view'd her were enamour'd on her.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And as in fury of a dreadful fight,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Their fellows being slain or put to flight,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Poor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Await the sentence of her scornful eyes;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
He whom she favours lives; the other dies.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There might you see one sigh, another rage,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And some, their violent passions to assuage,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Compile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For faithful love will never turn to hate.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And many, seeing great princes were denied,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Pin'd as they went, and thinking on her, died.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
On this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Went Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To Venus' temple, where unhappily,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As after chanc'd, they did each other spy.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So fair a church as this had Venus none:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The walls were of discolour'd jasper-stone,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Wherein was Proteus carved; and over-head,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A lively vine of green sea-agate spread,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Of crystal shining fair the pavement was;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
The town of Sestos call'd it Venus' glass:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There might you see the gods in sundry shapes,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Committing heady riots, incest, rapes:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For know, that underneath this radiant flower",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was Danae's statue in a brazen tower,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Jove slyly stealing from his sister's bed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To dally with Idalian Ganimed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And for his love Europa bellowing loud,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Blood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Love kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Sylvanus weeping for the lovely boy,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That now is turn'd into a cypress tree,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Under whose shade the wood-gods love to be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And in the midst a silver altar stood:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There Hero, sacrificing turtles' blood,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Vail'd to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And modestly they opened as she rose.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thence flew Love's arrow with the golden head;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And thus Leander was enamoured.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Stone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Relenting Hero's gentle heart was strook:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such force and virtue hath an amorous look.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"         It lies not in our power to love or hate,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When two are stript, long ere the course begin,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"We wish that one should lose, the other win;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And one especially do we affect,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of two gold ingots, like in each respect:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The reason no man knows, let it suffice,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
What we behold is censur'd by our eyes.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Where both deliberate, the love is slight:",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

How to a benefice he might aspire.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Marry, there (said the priest) ""is art indeed:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;,renaissance_mythology_folklore

How to obtain a beneficial.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yourself attired, as you can devise,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Then to some nobleman yourself apply,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Or other great one in the worldes eye,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That hath a zealous disposition,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To God, and so to his religion.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There thou must walk in sober gravity,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And unto every one do courtesy meek:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And if thee list unto the court to throng,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And there to hunt after the hoped prey,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then must thou thee dispose another way:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Unless thou canst one conjure by device,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And if one could, it were but a school trick.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
These be the ways by which without reward,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For nothing there is done without a fee:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
The courtier needs must recompensed be,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"And he will care for all the rest to shift,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Both that the bishop may admit of thee,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For learning sake to living them to raise;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But, ere long time had passed, they so ill",renaissance_mythology_folklore

Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"How foully they their offices abus'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That pursuivants he often for them sent;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
But they neglected his commandement.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So long persisted obstinate and bold,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till at the length he published to hold,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A visitation, and them cited thether:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then was high time their wits about to geather.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"What did they then, but made a composition",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With their next neighbour priest, for light condition,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
To whom their living they resigned quite,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For a few pence, and ran away by night.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"CALM was the day, and through the trembling air",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Sweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A gentle spirit, that lightly did delay",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Hot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When I whose sullen care,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Through discontent of my long fruitless stay,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In prince's court, and expectation vain",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of idle hopes, which still do fly away",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Like empty shadows, did afflict my brain,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Walked forth to ease my pain,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Along the shore of silver streaming Thames,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whose rutty bank, the which his river hems,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Was painted all with variable flowers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And all the meads adorned with dainty gems,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Fit to deck maidens' bowers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And crown their paramours,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against the bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There, in a meadow, by the river's side,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"A flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All lovely daughters of the flood thereby,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As each had been a bride;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And each one had a little wicker basket,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Made of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
And with fine fingers cropt full featously,renaissance_mythology_folklore
The tender stalks on high.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of every sort, which in that meadow grew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They gathered some; the violet pallid blue,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The little daisy, that at evening closes,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The virgin lily, and the primrose true,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With store of vermeil roses,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
To deck their bridegrooms' posies,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against the bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With that, I saw two swans of goodly hue",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Come softly swimming down along the Lee;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Two fairer birds I yet did never see.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Did never whiter shew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Nor Jove himself, when he a swan would be",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"For love of Leda, whiter did appear:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet Leda was they say as white as he,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet not so white as these, nor nothing near.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So purely white they were,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That even the gentle stream, the which them bare,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Seemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To wet their silken feathers, lest they might",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Soil their fair plumes with water not so fair,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And mar their beauties bright,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That shone as heaven's light,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Eftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Ran all in haste, to see that silver brood,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
As they came floating on the crystal flood.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whom when they saw, they stood amazed still,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Their wondering eyes to fill.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Them seemed they never saw a sight so fair,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Them heavenly born, or to be that same pair",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which through the sky draw Venus' silver team;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
For sure they did not seem,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To be begot of any earthly seed,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"But rather angels, or of angels' breed:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"In sweetest season, when each flower and weed",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The earth did fresh array,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So fresh they seemed as day,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Even as their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Then forth they all out of their baskets drew,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Great store of flowers, the honour of the field,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That to the sense did fragrant odours yield,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All which upon those goodly birds they threw,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And all the waves did strew,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That like old Peneus' waters they did seem,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"When down along by pleasant Tempe's shore,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Scattered with flowers, through Thessaly they stream,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That they appear through lilies' plenteous store,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Like a bride's chamber floor.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Two of those nymphs meanwhile, two garlands bound,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Of freshest flowers which in that mead they found,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The which presenting all in trim array,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Their snowy foreheads therewithal they crowned,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whilst one did sing this lay,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Prepared against that day,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Against their bridal day, which was not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"'Ye gentle birds, the world's fair ornament,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And heaven's glory, whom this happy hour",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Doth lead unto your lovers' blissful bower,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Joy may you have and gentle heart's content,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Of your love's complement:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And let fair Venus, that is queen of love,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With her heart-quelling son upon you smile,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Whose smile, they say, hath virtue to remove",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"All love's dislike, and friendship's faulty guile",renaissance_mythology_folklore
For ever to assoil.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Let endless peace your steadfast hearts accord,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And blessed plenty wait upon your board,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And let your bed with pleasures chaste abound,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Upon your bridal day, which is not long:",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.'",renaissance_mythology_folklore
So ended she; and all the rest around,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To her redoubled that her undersong,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which said their bridal day should not be long.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And gentle echo from the neighbour ground,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Their accents did resound.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"So forth those joyous birds did pass along,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Adown the Lee, that to them murmured low,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"As he would speak, but that he lacked a tongue,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Yet did by signs his glad affection show,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Making his stream run slow.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And all the fowl which in his flood did dwell,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Gan flock about these twain, that did excel",renaissance_mythology_folklore
The rest so far as Cynthia doth shend,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The lesser stars. So they, enranged well,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Did on those two attend,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"And their best service lend,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"At length they all to merry London came,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To merry London, my most kindly nurse,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
That to me gave this life's first native source;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Though from another place I take my name,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
An house of ancient fame.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There when they came, whereas those bricky towers,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"The which on Thames' broad aged back do ride,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where now the studious lawyers have their bowers,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"There whilom wont the Templar Knights to bide,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Till they decayed through pride:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Next whereunto there stands a stately place,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Where oft I gained gifts and goodly grace,renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Joy have thou of thy noble victory,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

That promiseth the same:,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"That through thy prowess and victorious arms,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Thy country may be freed from foreign harms;,renaissance_mythology_folklore
And great Elisa's glorious name may ring,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Through all the world, filled with thy wide alarms,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Which some brave Muse may sing,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"To ages following,",renaissance_mythology_folklore

"Descended to the river's open viewing,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
With a great train ensuing.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Above the rest were goodly to be seen,renaissance_mythology_folklore
Two gentle knights of lovely face and feature,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Beseeming well the bower of any queen,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"With gifts of wit and ornaments of nature,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
Fit for so goodly stature;,renaissance_mythology_folklore

Which deck the baldric of the heavens bright.,renaissance_mythology_folklore
"They two forth pacing to the river's side,",renaissance_mythology_folklore
"Received those two fair birds, their love's delight;",renaissance_mythology_folklore
